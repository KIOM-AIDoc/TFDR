31331582|t|A multicenter study on the efficacy and safety of So-Cheong-Ryong-Tang for perennial allergic rhinitis.
31331582|a|BACKGROUND: So-Cheong-Ryong-Tang (SCRT), also known as Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang or Sho-seiryo-to, is a mixed herbal formula that is used to treat allergic rhinitis, bronchitis, allergic asthma, and common cold in traditional Korean medicine. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of the SCRT for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study of Korean adults with perennial allergic rhinitis. The trial consisted of a 4-week oral administration of SCRT or placebo, with two visits at 2-week intervals, and an 8-week follow-up period, with two visits at 4-week intervals. The primary outcome was a change in the total nasal symptoms score. The secondary outcomes included changes in the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score, total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), cytokines levels, and nasal endoscopy index. RESULTS: SCRT improved nasal symptoms and quality of life in patients with PAR after 4 weeks medication, and these effects did not last 8 weeks after the end of medication. The level of serum IgE, eosinophil counts, and cytokines did not alter after medication. Nasal endoscopy index did not show significant difference. No serious AEs and safety assessment changes were observed in this trial. CONCLUSION: SCRT is an effective and safe medication for patients with chronic, perennial, and moderate to severe AR. A clinical study with a >4-week period of medication use, and more participants for immune material test is needed to investigate the long-term efficacy of SCRT in relieving the symptoms of nasal obstruction and identifying the underlying mechanisms of action and indications for traditional Korean medicine.

12120187|t|Effect of herbal medicine keishi-to (TJ-45) and its components on rat pancreatic acinar cell injuries in vivo and in vitro.
12120187|a|BACKGROUND: In an attempt to clarify the mechanism of the effect of a herbal medicine, Saiko-keishi-to (TJ-10), which is a combination of Keishi-to (TJ-45) and Sho-saiko-to (TJ-9), we investigated the effects of these two herbal medicines and their components on pancreatic acinar cell injury models in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Four-week-old male WBN/Kob rats were fed an MB-3 pellet diet containing herbal medicine (TJ-9, TJ-10 and TJ-45). Expressions of pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) were analyzed with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. The herbal medicines and two of their components, Keihi (Cinnamomi cortex) and Shakuyaku (Paeoniae radix alba), were tested in vitro using an arginine-treated rat pancreatic acinar AR4-2J cell injury model. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was assayed in in vitro experiments. RESULTS: TJ-45-treated WBN/Kob rats showed no evidence of pancreatitis whereas there were pathological changes of chronic pancreatitis in TJ-9-treated WBN/Kob rats. PAP was not expressed and Mn-SOD expression was increased in the TJ-10-, and TJ-45-treated rats. The herbal medicines and two components suppressed PAP mRNA expression and enhanced Mn-SOD and iNOS mRNA expression in arginine-treated AR4-2J cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the herbal medicine TJ-45 is effective for chronic pancreatitis caused by pancreatic ischemia.

20117976|t|[Effect of Liuweidihuang pills in preventing diabetes mellitus in OLETF rats].
20117976|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Liuweidihuang pills in preventing diabetes in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. METHODS: Forty male OLETF rats were randomized equally into Liuweidihuang pill group and control group, with 10 male LETO rats as the normal control group. In Liuweidihuang pill group, the rats were given the pills intragastrically at the daily dose of 2.4 mg/kg since 8 weeks of age, and the rats in the other two groups received water instead. Blood glucose of the rats was determined by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and the body weight and food intake were monitored on a weekly basis. At 8, 32 and 40 weeks, the rats were sacrificed and the expression level of adiponectin mRNA in the adipose tissue was detected using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Treatment with Liuweidihuang pills significantly lowered the increment of the blood glucose and postponed the onset of hyperglycemia in the rats. Compared with the control group, the rats in Liuweidihuang pill group showed significantly increased expression of adiponectin mRNA in the adipose tissue. The rats receiving Liuweidihuang pills developed diabetes at 30 weeks of age with an incidence of 28.6% at 40 weeks, significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Liuweidihuang pills can significantly increase the expression of adiponectin mRNA in the adipose tissue and decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes in OLETF rats.

29990483|t|Sini decoction alleviates E. coli induced acute lung injury in mice via equilibrating ACE-AngII-AT1R and ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis.
29990483|a|AIMS: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), one of the serious form of acute lung injury (ALI), is the primary cause of death in patients with ALI. Sini decoction (SND) is a widely used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). However, the application of SND in ALI is rarely reported. Previous studies have found that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) played vital and bidirectional roles in ALI. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate protective effect of SND on ALI model induced by E. coli, as well as to further explore relations between RAAS and SND. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ALI model was evaluated by morphological observations and biochemical assays. The expression levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) were examined by Western blotting. The expression levels of angiotensinII (AngII) and angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) were measured through ELISA. MasR, IL-6, IL-1beta and TNFalpha were all measured using qRT-PCR. KEY FINDINGS: SND significantly ameliorated E. coli-induced ALI, including reducing inflammatory factors in lung tissue and the activity of MPO in serum. Furthermore, SND could obviously decrease the expression of ACE, AngII and AT1R, which were induced by E. coli. On the other hand, SND could markedly activate ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: In this paper, we demonstrated that SND alleviates E. coli induced acute lung injury in mice via equilibrating ACE-AngII-AT1R and ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis.

33505838|t|Effect of Gegenqinlian decoction on intestinal mucosal flora in mice with diarrhea induced by high temperature and humidity treatment.
33505838|a|The objective of this study is to investigate the regulation effects of the active ingredients in Gegenqinlian Decoction (GD) on the intestinal mucosal flora of mice with diarrhea induced by high temperature and humidity based on systems pharmacology approach. Fifteen mice were randomly assigned to three equal groups of five mice, namely control (ctcm) group, model (ctmm) group and treatment (cttm) group. Mice in the cttm group were given 20 mL/kg of GD and sterile water was used as a placebo control twice a day for four consecutive days. We used the third-generation molecular high-throughput sequencing technology to measure the intestinal mucosal flora changes in mice. Combined with network pharmacology to predict the medicinal substances and action targets of GD against diarrhea. Results showed that Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) number and Alpha diversity in the intestinal mucosal flora of cttm group recovered and higher than that of the ctcm group. There were differences in the community structure between the ctmm and cttm groups in the Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). The relative abundance results indicated dominant bacteria species (such as Lactobacillus crispatus, Muribaculum intestinal, Neisseria mucosa) in the intestinal mucosa of the three groups. Moreover, we screened out 146 active ingredients in GD corresponding to 252 component targets, and 328 disease targets in diarrhea to obtain 31 drug-disease common targets. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks mainly involved the core proteins such as Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Enrichment analyses showed that GD played a role in the treatment of diarrhea by regulating the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and adipocytokine signaling pathways and so on. In brief, the active ingredients of GD could intervene from oxidative stress and inflammatory response through multiple targets and multiple channels to adjust the balance of intestinal mucosa flora, thereby playing a role in the treatment of diarrhea. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-020-02628-0.

35221266|t|Protective effects of Banhasasim-tang, a herbal medicine, against cold restraint stress-induced gastric ulcers.
35221266|a|Banhasasim-tang (BST), a herbal medicine, has been used for nausea and fever from cold damage. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of BST in cold restraint stress-induced gastric ulcers. Male Sprague Dawley rats were orally treated with various doses of BST including 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18g/kg based on the human daily intake dose. After treatment once per day for 3 days, rats were restrained into the cold stress chamber for 12h at 4 degrees C to induce gastric ulcers. Gastric hemorrhagic ulcer area was evaluated and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone, epinephrine and dopamine levels were determined. Compared to cold stress-induced gastric ulcer rats, hemorrhage ulcer areas were reduced in BST-treated stomach tissues at all concentrations. Increased serum ACTH, corticosterone and epinephrine levels were significantly decreased by BST treatment in cold stress-induced gastric ulcer rats. Moreover, there were increments of serum dopamine levels in 3 and 6g/kg of BST-treated groups. Taken together, BST positively ameliorated cold restraint stress-induced gastric hemorrhage with decrease in serum stress-related biomarkers such as ACTH, corticosterone, epinephrine and dopamine. The 3-6-fold of human daily intake dose of BST exhibited protective effects as a herbal medicine for gastric ulcers.

32160845|t|Virtual Screening of the Multi-pathway and Multi-gene Regulatory Molecular Mechanism of Dachengqi Decoction in the Treatment of Stroke Based on Network Pharmacology.
32160845|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is ranked second among diseases that cause mortality worldwide. Owing to its complicated pathogenesis, no satisfactory treatment strategies for stroke are available. Dachengqi decoction (DCQD), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been widely used in China for a long time, as it has a good effect on stroke. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect of DCQD is unclear. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we aimed to reveal and explore the multi-pathway and multi-gene regulatory molecular mechanism of Dachengqi decoction in the treatment of stroke. METHODS: In this study, a network pharmacology method, in combination with oral bioavailability prediction and drug-likeness evaluation, was employed to predict the active ingredients of DCQD. The target genes of the active components and the traced pathways related to these target genes were predicted. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed using clusterProfiler software package on the R platform and ClueGo+CluePedia plug-ins. Finally, the key DCQD targets were verified using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: According to the ADME model, 52 active components were screened from 296 active components of DCQD. After prediction and screening, 215 stroke-related targets were obtained and analyzed via GO and KEGG analyses. GO analysis showed that DCQD targets were mainly involved in the regulation of oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and other biological processes. KEGG pathway analysis further revealed pathways involved in stroke, such as arachidonic acid metabolic, HIF-1 signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, platelet activation pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and cAMP signaling pathway. Network analysis revealed that DCQD might be involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, blood pressure, inflammation, angiogenesis, neuroprotection, platelet aggregation, apoptosis, and oxidation in stroke treatment. GEO dataset analysis showed that DCQD's therapeutic effects might be exerted via the bidirectional regulation principle. CONCLUSION: Based on the methods of network pharmacology and GEO analysis, it was found that, during stroke treatment, DCQD regulates and controls multiple genes and multiple pathways in a synergistic manner, providing a new strategy for stroke treatment.

31192922|t|The prescription patterns of traditional Chinese medicine for women with polycystic ovary syndrome in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study.
31192922|a|Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease of reproductive-age women, accounting for about 9% to 18% of all women in this age group. Hyperandrogenemia, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea or anovulation, and polycystic ovary morphology are the 3 main criteria used to diagnose PCOS currently. Substantial scientific evidence and consensus on treating Taiwanese PCOS was lacking. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics and utilization of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) among Taiwanese women with PCOS.The data used in this study were derived from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID 2000 and LHID 2005). Demographic characteristics, TCM usage, the frequency, as well as average daily dose of Chinese herbal formulas and the single herbs prescribed for patients with PCOS, were analyzed. Chinese herbal formulas and the single herbs prescribed for PCOS women during 1999 to 2013 were extracted to build up Chinese Herbal Medicine prescription database.In our study, 66.43% (n = 8205) women sought TCM treatment because of PCOS for infertility or menstrual disorders. The most commonly prescribed Chinese herbal formula was Jia-wei-xiao-yao-san (Supplemented Free Wanderer Powder). The most commonly prescribed single herb was Yi-mu-cao (Leonuri herba). Among top 20 Chinese herbal formulas, Si-wu-tang has the largest average daily dosage (9.60 g).Our study identified the characteristics and prescription patterns of TCM for patients with PCOS in Taiwan. We may need do further longitudinal research for TCM and its long-term response for improvement of pregnancy rate and reduction of metabolic disease rate.

29861771|t|Systems Pharmacology Dissection of Traditional Chinese Medicine Wen-Dan Decoction for Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases.
29861771|a|Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have been recognized as first killer of human health. The underlying mechanisms of CVDs are extremely complicated and not fully revealed, leading to a challenge for CVDs treatment in modern medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) characterized by multiple compounds and targets has shown its marked effects on CVDs therapy. However, system-level understanding of the molecular mechanisms is still ambiguous. In this study, a system pharmacology approach was developed to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms of a clinically effective herb formula (Wen-Dan Decoction) in treating CVDs. 127 potential active compounds and their corresponding 283 direct targets were identified in Wen-Dan Decoction. The networks among active compounds, targets, and diseases were built to reveal the pharmacological mechanisms of Wen-Dan Decoction. A "CVDs pathway" consisted of several regulatory modules participating in therapeutic effects of Wen-Dan Decoction in CVDs. All the data demonstrates that Wen-Dan Decoction has multiscale beneficial activity in CVDs treatment, which provides a new way for uncovering the molecular mechanisms and new evidence for clinical application of Wen-Dan Decoction in cardiovascular disease.

9234626|t|[Five cases of pneumonitis induced by sho-saiko-to].
9234626|a|We report five cases of pneumonitis induced by sho-saiko-to. The patients complained of coughing (4/5), dyspnea (4/5), and pyrexia (3/5). The duration of sho-saiko-to treatment ranged from 4 to 1155 days. Abnormal laboratory findings included high levels of C-reactive protein (4/5), leucocytosis (4/5), severe hypoxemia (4/5), low vital capacity (3/5), and low diffusing capacity (5/5). Chest X-ray and CT films revealed diffuse reticulonodular or ground-glass shadows in both lung fields (4/5). Bronchoalveolar lavage was done in three cases, and revealed lymphocytosis in two cases and abnormally low CD4/8 ratios in three cases. The results of lymphocyte stimulation tests against sho-saiko-to and its component were positive in 3 of 5 cases. After discontinuation of sho-saiko-to, corticosteroids were given in all cases. Symptoms were relieved, and laboratory data and chest X-ray findings returned forward normal. Sho-saiko-to toxicity should be included in the differential diagnosis of pneumonitis. If drug-induced pneumonitis is suspected, administration of sho-saiko-to should be stopped and corticosteroid therapy should be given immediately.

32547403|t|Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San Improves Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis by Inhibiting Caspase-1/Caspase-11-Mediated Pyroptosis.
32547403|a|The traditional Chinese medicine Shen-ling-bai-zhu-san (SLBZS) is described in "Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang." SLBZS has been shown to be effective against many gastrointestinal diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of SLBZS on experimental colitis in mice and to define the potential mechanisms. Our data suggest that compared to the model group, SLBZS treatment increases mouse body weight and colon length, decreases the DAI score, and improves colonic injury. SLBZS reduces the production of cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha) in colon tissue and mouse colonic mucosal epithelial (MCME) cells. Mechanistically, SLBZS inhibits inflammation by inhibiting the MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Further mechanistic analyses showed that SLBZS attenuates the expression levels of pyroptosis-related genes, including NLRP3, ASC, and GSDMD-N in the colons of mice. In addition, SLBZS restores the levels of the colon tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin, suggesting that it protects colonic barrier integrity and ameliorates the progression of colitis. In this paper, we demonstrate that SLBZS attenuates DSS-induced ulcerative colitis injury in mice via the MAPK/NF-kappaB and pyroptosis signaling pathway. These results indicate that SLBZS is a potential drug for the treatment of UC.

34301291|t|Insights into the molecular mechanisms of Huangqi decoction on liver fibrosis via computational systems pharmacology approaches.
34301291|a|BACKGROUND: The traditional Chinese medicine Huangqi decoction (HQD) consists of Radix Astragali and Radix Glycyrrhizae in a ratio of 6: 1, which has been used for the treatment of liver fibrosis. In this study, we tried to elucidate its action of mechanism (MoA) via a combination of metabolomics data, network pharmacology and molecular docking methods. METHODS: Firstly, we collected prototype components and metabolic products after administration of HQD from a publication. With known and predicted targets, compound-target interactions were obtained. Then, the global compound-liver fibrosis target bipartite network and the HQD-liver fibrosis protein-protein interaction network were constructed, separately. KEGG pathway analysis was applied to further understand the mechanisms related to the target proteins of HQD. Additionally, molecular docking simulation was performed to determine the binding efficiency of compounds with targets. Finally, considering the concentrations of prototype compounds and metabolites of HQD, the critical compound-liver fibrosis target bipartite network was constructed. RESULTS: 68 compounds including 17 prototype components and 51 metabolic products were collected. 540 compound-target interactions were obtained between the 68 compounds and 95 targets. Combining network analysis, molecular docking and concentration of compounds, our final results demonstrated that eight compounds (three prototype compounds and five metabolites) and eight targets (CDK1, MMP9, PPARD, PPARG, PTGS2, SERPINE1, TP53, and HIF1A) might contribute to the effects of HQD on liver fibrosis. These interactions would maintain the balance of ECM, reduce liver damage, inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis, and alleviate liver inflammation through five signaling pathways including p53, PPAR, HIF-1, IL-17, and TNF signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a new way to understand the MoA of HQD on liver fibrosis by considering the concentrations of components and metabolites, which might be a model for investigation of MoA of other Chinese herbs.

16523407|t|Suppression of transforming growth factor-beta1 gene expression by Danggui buxue tang, a traditional Chinese herbal preparation, in retarding the progress of renal damage in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
16523407|a|Danggui buxue tang (DBT), a preparation containing Angelica sinensis (danggui) and Astragalus membranaceus (huangqi) at a ratio of 1 : 5, is used widely in China for stimulating red blood cell production and enhancing cardiovascular function. The present study was undertaken to characterize the effects of this preparation on diabetic nephropathy using streptozotocin-diabetic rats as a model. Streptozotocin-dependent alterations in renal weight/body weight ratio, urinary albumin and beta (2)-microglobulin concentrations, urinary albumin excretion rate, and creatinine clearance were ameliorated after eight weeks of treatment with either DBT or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, benazepril. DBT, but not benazepril, partially attenuated the increases in blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol in STZ-diabetic rats. Additionally, the increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta (1) mRNA in the renal cortex due to streptozotocin-induced diabetes was modestly attenuated by these treatments. However, eight weeks of treatment with DBT failed to modify the concentration of angiotensin II in plasma or kidney, indicating that the ability of the preparation to retard the progression of kidney disease was not attributable to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. We propose that DBT alleviates renal alterations in diabetes and slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy by suppressing transforming growth factor-beta (1) mRNA expression. The preparation may therefore be useful as an adjuvant therapy for controlling diabetes and its complications.

35003311|t|The Study of Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang Preventing and Treating Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease through PPAR Signaling Pathway Based on Network Pharmacology and RNA-Seq Transcriptomics.
35003311|a|BACKGROUND: Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is the first stage of the alcoholic liver disease course. Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang (YCHT) has a good clinical effect on the treatment of AFLD, but its molecular mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, we tried to explore the molecular mechanism of YCHT in improving hepatocyte steatosis in AFLD mice through network pharmacology and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) transcriptomics. METHODS: Network pharmacological methods were used to analyze the potential therapeutic signaling pathways and targets of YCHT on AFLD. Then, the AFLD mice model was induced and YCHT was administered concurrently. Liver injury was measured by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and liver tissue H&E staining, and liver steatosis was determined by serum triglyceride (TG) level and liver tissue Oil Red staining. The molecular mechanism of YCHT on prevention and treatment of mice AFLD was investigated according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the differential expression genes data obtained by liver tissue RNA-Seq. Finally, ethanol-induced AFLD AML12 hepatocyte model was established, YCHT with or without PPARalpha agonist pemafibrate or PPARgamma inhibitor GW9662 was administered, Nile Red fluorescent staining was used to evaluate steatosis levels in AML12 hepatocytes, and qRT-PCR was used to detect PPARalpha and PPARgamma gene expression. RESULTS: The results of network pharmacology analysis showed that YCHT may exert its pharmacological effect on AFLD through 312 potential targets which are involved in many signaling pathways including the PPAR signaling pathway. AFLD mice experiments results showed that YCHT markedly decreased mice serum ALT activity and serum TG levels. YCHT also significantly improved alcohol-induced hepatic injury and steatosis in mice livers. Furthermore, KEGG pathway enrichment results of RNA-Seq showed that the PPAR signaling pathway should be the most relevant pathway of YCHT in the prevention and treatment of AFLD. AFLD hepatocyte model experiment results showed that YCHT could remarkably reduce hepatocyte steatosis through reducing PPARgamma expression and increasing PPARalpha expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study discovered that PPARgamma and PPARalpha are the key targets and the PPAR signaling pathway is the main signaling pathway for YCHT to prevent and treat AFLD.

Three hundred and fifty-two post-menopausal women aged 46-58 years (mean: 53.4 +/- 3.6 years) with climacteric complaints participated in the study. One hundred and thirty-one patients with hot flashes were treated with HRT (64 cases) or herbal therapy (67 cases). Blood flow was measured with laser doppler fluxmetry under the jaw, in the middle finger and in the third toe. Post-menopausal women with hot flashes (129 cases) showed significantly higher blood flow under the jaw (13.6 +/- 4.13) than women without hot flashes (166 cases) (5.48 +/- 0.84) (p < 0.0001). Blood flow at this site decreased significantly with either therapy (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the administration of Gui-zhi-fu-lingwan significantly increased (p = 0.002) the blood flow in the lower extremities, whereas HRT decreased the blood flow. Thus, we have demonstrated that Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan did not affect the activity of vasodilator neuropeptides on sensory neurons of systemic peripheral vessels uniformly. Therefore, Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan, rather than HRT, is suggested as an appropriate therapy for treatment of hot flashes in the face and upper body with concomitant coldness in the lower body, which is one of the symptoms of menopause.

27239212|a|To investigate whether Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng-Tang (DHJST) attenuate inflammation of RA related to lymphatic drainage function in vivo, we treated eight 3-month-old TNF-Tg mice with DHJST (12 g/kg) or the same volume of physiological saline once every day for 12 weeks, and 3-month-old WT littermates were used as negative control. After twelve weeks, we performed NIR-ICG imaging and found that DHJST increased the ICG clearance at the footpad and the pulse of efferent lymphatic vessel between popliteal lymph node and footpad. Histology staining at ankle joints showed that DHJST decreases synovial inflammation, bone erosion, cartilage erosion, and TRAP+ osteoclast area in TNF-Tg mice. Immunohistochemical staining by using anti-Lyve-1 and anti-podoplanin antibody showed that DHJST stimulated lymphangiogenesis in ankle joints of TNF-Tg mice. And zebrafish study suggested that DHJST promoted the formation of lymphatic thoracic duct. In conclusion, DHJST inhibits inflammation severity and promotes lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic drainage function of TNF-Tg mice.

29179457|t|Traditional Chinese medicine Danggui Buxue Tang inhibits colorectal cancer growth through induction of autophagic cell death.
29179457|a|PURPOSE: The induction of autophagic cell death is an important process in the development of anticancer therapeutics. We aimed to evaluate the activity of the ancient Chinese decoction Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT) against colorectal cancer (CRC) and the associated autophagy-related mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT26 CRC cells were implanted into syngeneic BALB/c mice for the tumor growth assay. DBT extracts and DBT-PD (polysaccharide-depleted) fractions were orally administered. The toxicity profiles of the extracts were analyzed using measurements of body weight, hemogram, and biochemical parameters. The morphology of tissue sections was observed using light and transmission electron microscopy. Western blotting and small interference RNA assays were used to determine the mechanism. RESULTS: DBT-PD and DBT, which contained an equal amount of DBT-PD, inhibited CT26 syngeneic tumor growth. In the tumor specimen, the expression of microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B) was upregulated by DBT-PD and DBT. The development of autophagosomes was observed via transmission electron microscopy in tumors treated with DBT-PD and DBT. In vitro experiments for mechanism clarification demonstrated that DBT-PD could induce autophagic death in CT26 cells accompanied by LC3B lipidation, downregulation of phospho-p70(s6k), and upregulation of Atg7. RNA interference of Atg7, but not Atg5, partially reversed the effect of DBT-PD on LC3B lipidation and expression of phospho-p70(s6k) and Atg7. The changes in ultrastructural morphology and LC3B expression induced by DBT-PD were also partially blocked by the knockdown of Atg7 mRNA. CONCLUSION: DBT induced autophagic death of colorectal cancer cells through the upregulation of Atg7 and modulation of the mTOR/p70(s6k) signaling pathway.

14768364|t|[The effects of bakumondo-to (mai-men-dong-tang) on asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients with increased cough sensitivity].
14768364|a|UNLABELLED: Some patients with bronchial asthma (BA) have increased throat sensitivity. In some instances, it is envisaged that this may result in increased coughing or wheezing. Bakumondo-to is a traditional herbal medicine that is well known to reduce coughing in patients with BA and chronic bronchitis. AIM: The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of Bakumondo-to on cough sensitivity in patients with BA and non-asthmatic (non-BA) conditions. The effect on respiratory tract inflammation was also examined. METHODS: We examined 21 BA and 22 non-BA subjects whose cough threshold for capsaicin was less than 3.9 microM. We prepared 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.2, 15.6, 7.80, 3.90, 1.95, 0.98, and 0.49 microM solutions. Cough thresholds to a concentration of inhaled capsaicin solution causing 5 or more coughs was measured before treatment and after 2 months or more of treatment with Bakumondo-to (9 g/day, TJ-29). The number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood, the sputum eosinophil ratio, and the ECP level in the serum were also measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: 1. Bakumondo-to significantly improved the cough threshold value in 76% of patients with BA and in 82% with non-BA conditions. 2. Bakumondo-to was more effective in reducing cough sensitivity to capsaicin in BA than in non-BA conditions. 3. While Bakumondo-to did not significantly reduce the sputum eosinophil count, its effectiveness in suppressing cough was greatest in patients whose sputum eosinophil count was > or = 2%. It remains to be established whether Bakumondo-to inhibits eosinophil activation. Our results suggest that Bakumondo-to is an effective therapeutic preparation for cough hypersensitivity accompanying chronic cough disease, especially in cases of severe allergic inflammation.

31526861|t|You-Gui-Yin improved the reproductive dysfunction of male rats with chronic kidney disease via regulating the HIF1alpha-STAT5 pathway.
31526861|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: You-Gui-Yin (YGY) is a famous Chinese traditional medicine compound that has been used to treat renal function diseases for more than 300 years. It is recorded in Jing Yue Quanshu, which was written by a famous medical scientist named Jiebing Zhang in the Ming Dynasty. AIM OF THE STUDY: Reproductive dysfunction is one of the most serious complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to observe the effect of You-Gui-Yin (YGY) on reproductive dysfunction of male rats with adenine-induced CKD and to determine if any effects occurred via regulation of the HIF1alpha-STAT5 pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS was used to detect the main medicinal components and conduct quality control of YGY. A total of 60 rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: the NC group (10 rats) and the CKD model group (50 rats). The CKD model rats was established by administration of adenine 150mgkg(-1) orally for 14 days. After that, the CKD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: the CKD group, YGY (10gkg(-1) group, 20gkg(-1) group, 40gkg(-1) group) and the GUI-LU-ER-XIAN-JIAO (GL) 10gkg(-1) group with 10 rats in each group. From the 15th day to the 45th day rats were given 150mgkg(-1) adenine orally every other day to maintain the model (except in the NC group). The YGY groups and the GL group were orally administered the relevant drug once per day for 30 days. The NC group and the CKD group were orally administered an equal volume of normal saline for 30 days. On the 45th day, the rats' sexual behavior index was tested. On the 46th day, the rats were sacrificed. Biochemical indexes, histopathological changes of the kidneys and testes, sperm morphology, sperm abnormality rate, and key proteins in the HIF1alpha-STAT5 pathway in the kidney and testis were detected. RESULTS: Thirteen components in the YGY extract were identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS for quality control of the YGY extract. The results of the biochemical and physiological tests validated the success of inducing CKD accompanied by reproductive dysfunction in rats. YGY significantly retarded the CKD progression and improved the hormone levels of male CKD rats. Sexual behavior tests showed YGY can significantly improve CKD rats' sexual function. In addition, the pathological changes of the kidney and testis, sperm abnormality rate and sperm morphological abnormalities of the CKD rats were reduced by YGY. Furthermore, decreased expression of HIF1alpha and EPO, and increased expression of p-EPOR (Tyr368), p-JAK2 (Tyr570) and p-STAT5 (Ser725) were observed in the kidney and the testis of the CKD rats. The YGY extract dramatically increased the expression of HIF1alpha and EPO, and decreased the expression of p-EPOR (Tyr368), p-JAK2 (Tyr570) and p-STAT5 (Ser725) to regulate key proteins in the HIF1alpha-STAT5 pathway of the kidney and testis. CONCLUSIONS: YGY has obvious reversal effects on the abnormal symptoms of adenine-induced CKD and the abnormal symptoms of rats with hypothyroidism and male reproductive hypotension. Its mechanism is related to its ability to regulate the HIF1alpha-STAT5 pathway.

24199573|t|[Comparative study on hepatic toxicity of gardeniae fructus and Huanglian Jiedu decoction].
24199573|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of ingredients in Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDT) combined with Gardeniae Fructus on the hepatic toxicity of Gardeniae Fructus and its mechanism. METHOD: Rats were given Gardeniae Fructus and HLJDT decoction at the dose of 10 times of clinical dosage for 3 days. Their ALT AST, ALP, TBA were detected, and their liver weight index was calculated. SOD activity, MDA content, GSH-PX activity, TNF-alpha content in hepatic tissues were determined. The cell apoptosis in liver tissue was determined by TUNEL, and the expressions of apoptosis related proteins Bax, Bcl-2 were measured by immunohistochemical method. RESULT: Compared with the normal control group, the Gardeniae Fructus group showed significant increase in the liver weight index, ALT, AST, TBA and ALP, notable decrease in SOD, SOD/MDA and GSH-PX, and remarkable rise in MDA, TNF-a concentration, accumulated optical density, apoptosis index, Bax and Bax/Bcl-2. Compare with that in the Gardeniae Fructus group, the liver index, ALT, AST, TBA, ALP reduced obviously; SOD, SOD/MDA and GSH-PX markedly increased; MDA and TNF-alpha significantly reduced; the accumulated optical density and apoptosis index significantly reduced; and Bax/Bcl-2 was much lower in HLJDT group. CONCLUSION: The hepatic toxicity caused by Gardeniae Fructus may be related to inflammation, oxidative stress-induced hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis. Other ingredients in HLJDT, apart from Gardeniae Fructus, can decrease the hepatic toxicity caused by Gardeniae Fructus by increasing the enzyme activity eliminating radicals and inhibiting hepatocyte injury caused by inflammatory reaction against Gardeniae Fructus.

33424599|t|Taohong Siwu Decoction Ameliorates Ischemic Stroke Injury Via Suppressing Pyroptosis.
33424599|a|Objective: Taohong Siwu decoction (THSWD) is one of the classic prescriptions for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, and it has a good therapeutic effect on ischemic stroke. We sought to explore the therapeutic effects of THSWD on pyroptosis in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO/R). Methods: MCAO/R model of rats were established by suture-occluded method. MCAO/R rats were randomly divided into five groups, which were model group, nimodipine group, THSWD high, medium and low dose group (18, 9, and 4.5 g/kg, respectively), rats of sham group without thread embolus. All rats were treated by intragastric administration for 7 days. We detected the level of inflammatory factors. NLRP3 and Caspase-1 were detected by immunofluorescence. Western blot was used to detect NLRP3, Caspase-1, ASC, and GSDMD in penumbra. Also, the expression of TXNIP, HMGB1, toll-like receptors (TLR4), NF-kappaB, and MAPK were detected. Results: THSWD treatment improved the behavioral function and brain pathological damage. These results showed that the levels of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IL-18 were significantly reduced in THSWD treatment groups. THSWD could significantly decrease the expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, Caspase-1 p10, ASC, TXNIP, GSDMD, HMGB1, TLR4/NFkappaB, p38 MAPK, and JNK in penumbra. Conclusion: Our results showed that THSWD could reduce the activation level of NLRP3 inflammatory corpuscle, down-regulate GSDMD, and inhibit pyroptosis in MCAO/R rats.

34387828|t|Effectiveness and Safety of Acupoint Application of Guan Xin Su He Pill () for Patients with Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris: A Multi-Center, Randomized Controlled Trial.
34387828|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness of acupoint application (AP) of Guan Xin Su He Pill (, GXSHP) for patients with chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP). METHODS: This study was carried out in 3 local hospitals in Chengdu, China. After baseline evaluation, eligible patients were randomly assigned to the placebo application for acupoints (PAA) group or the herbal application for acupoints (HAA) group. Patients in the HAA group underwent AP with herbal powder, which was mainly GXSHP, and patients in the PAA group underwent AP with sham drugs. For each treatment session, unilateral acupoints including Neiguan (PC 6), Danzhong (RN 17), Xinshu (BL 15) and Jueyinshu (BL 14), were stimulated for both groups. AP was performed 3 times a week with a 2-day interval for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the frequency of angina pectoris attacks per week, while the secondary outcomes included angina pain intensity measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), dose of rescue oral drugs (nitroglycerin), scores on the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale scores (SDS). Clinical outcomes were measured at week 0, 4 and 8. The safety of AP of GXSHP treatment for CSAP were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were comparable across the 2 groups. After treatment, the angina attack numbers in the HAA group were significantly reduced from 11.00 to 4.81 (P<0.05). While, for PAA group, the angina frequency was not significantly improved (baseline 10.55; post-treatment 11.05). The HAA group had significantly fewer angina attacks than the PAA group (P<0.05). Pain intensity measured by VAS in HAA group was significantly reduced from 4.06 to 3.02 (P<0.05). While, for PAA group, the VAS was significantly increased (baseline 3.62; post-treatment 3.96; P<0.05). Clinical outcomes showed better improvement after treatment in the HAA group than in the PAA group in terms of oral administration of rescue drugs, SAS, SDS and SAQ scores (P<0.05). The adverse events were also reported. CONCLUSION: AP of GXSHP is a safe and effective treatment for CSAP patients (Registration No. NCT02029118).

28086859|t|Cheongsangbangpung-tang ameliorated the acute inflammatory response via the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation and MAPK phosphorylation.
28086859|a|BACKGROUND: Cheongsangbangpung-tang (CBT) is a traditional herbal formula used in Eastern Asia to treat heat-related diseases and swellings in the skin. The present study was conducted to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of cheongsangbangpung-tang extract (CBTE) both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The in vitro effects of CBTE on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of inflammation-related proteins were examined in RAW 264.7 cells. The levels of nitric oxide (NO) were measured with the Griess reagent. Inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Inflammation-related proteins were detected by Western blot. The effect of CBTE on acute inflammation in vivo was evaluated using carrageenan (CA)-induced paw oedema. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect, paw oedema volume, thickness of the dorsum and ventrum pedis skin, number of infiltrated inflammatory cells, and number of COX-2-, iNOS-immunoreactive cells were measured. RESULTS: In an in vitro study, CBTE inhibited the production of NO and PGE2 and also decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and tumuor necrosis factor-alpha. In LPS-activated macrophages, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling is a pivotal pathway in the inflammatory process. These plausible molecular mechanisms increased the phosphorylation of I-kappaBalpha, while the activation of NF-kappaB and the phosphorylation of MAPK by LPS were blocked by CBTE treatment. In our in vivo study, a CA-induced acute oedematous paw inflammation rat model was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of CBTE. CBTE significantly reduced the increases in paw swelling, skin thicknesses, infiltrated inflammatory cells and iNOS-, COX-2 positive cells induced by CA injection. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, CBTE should favourably inhibit the acute inflammatory response through modulation of NF-kappaB activation and MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, the inhibition of CBTE in rat paw oedema induced by CA is considered to be clear evidence that CBTE may be a useful source to treat inflammation.

25847776|t|Wendan decoction () for treatment of schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
25847776|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of Wendan Decoction (, WDD) for the treatment of schizophrenia. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched until May 2014, including the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Chinese Scientist Journal Database, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing WDD against placebo, antipsychotic drugs, or WDD combined with antipsychotic drugs against antipsychotic drugs alone were included. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs (involving 1,174 patients) were included and the methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. The pooled results showed that WDD combined with antipsychotic drugs were more effective in clinical comprehensive effect, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores compared with antipsychotic drugs alone. However, WDD had less effectiveness compared with antipsychotics in clinical comprehensive effect; and WDD was not different from antipsychotic drugs for PANSS scores. The side effects were significantly reduced in the intervention group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: WDD appears to be effective on improving symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. However, due to poor methodological quality in the majority of the included trials, the potential benefit from WDD needs to be confirmed in rigorous trials and the design and reporting of trials should follow the international standards.
25847776|k|CONCLUSIONS: WDD appears to be effective on improving symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

25039185|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the reverse effect of Yinchenhao decoction(YCHD) in dimethyl nitrosamine (DMN)-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. METHOD: The rat hepatic fibrosis model was established through the intraperitoneal injection with 1% dimethyl nitrosamine (DMN) with a dose of 1.0 mL x kg(-1) x d(-1) for consecutively three weeks, once for the first three days of each. The rats were randomly divided into six groups: the silymarin positive control group (50.0 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), YCHD high (20.0 g x kg(-1) d(-1)), middle (8.0 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and low (3.2 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) dose groups, the model group and the normal control group. The model group and the normal control group were orally administered with normal saline for consecutively five weeks. The pathologic changes in liver tissues were observed by HE staining. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), g-glutamyltransferase (g-GGT), hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), collagen type IV (CIV) and type III procollagen amino terminal peptide (PIIINP) in serum were determined. The metabolite profiling of amino acid and the content of hydroxyproline in liver tissues were also measured. RESULT: Compared with the model group, YCHD high and middle dose groups could significantly reverse the pathologic changes in liver tissues of rats. YCHD could reduce the levels of ALT, AST, gamma-GGT, HA, LN, CIV, PIIINP in serum and the content of hydroxyproline in liver tissues in a dose-dependent manner, and altered the metabolite profiling of amino acid in rat liver tissues. CONCLUSION: YCHD has the effect in reversing dimethyl nitrosamine induced hepatic fibrosis in rats.

32476313|t|Anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects of Cheonwangbosim-dan against Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis.
32476313|a|BACKGROUND: There are various Helicobacter species colonizing the stomachs of animals. Although Helicobacter species usually cause asymptomatic infection in the hosts, clinical signs can occur due to gastritis associated with Helicobacter in animals. Among them, Helicobacter pylori is strongly associated with chronic gastritis, gastric ulcers, and gastric cancers. As the standard therapies used to treat H. pylori have proven insufficient, alternative options are needed to prevent and eradicate the diseases associated with this bacterium. Cheonwangbosim-dan (CBD), a traditional herbal formula that is popular in East Asia, has been commonly used for arterial or auricular flutter, neurosis, insomnia, and cardiac malfunction-induced disease. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the antimicrobial effect of CBD on H. pylori-infected human gastric carcinoma AGS cells and model mice. METHODS: AGS cells were infected with H. pylori and treated with a variety of concentrations of CBD or antibiotics. Mice were given 3 oral inoculations with H. pylori and then dosed with CBD (100 or 500 mg/kg) for 4 weeks or with standard antibiotics for 1 week. One week after the last treatment, gastric samples were collected and examined by histopathological analysis, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblotting. RESULTS: Our results showed that CBD treatment of AGS cells significantly reduced the H. pylori-induced elevations of interleukin-8, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In the animal model, CBD treatment inhibited the colonization of H. pylori and the levels of malondialdehyde, inflammation, proinflammatory cytokines, iNOS, and COX-2 in gastric tissues. CBD also decreased the phosphorylation levels of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase family. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that CBD might be a prospective candidate for treating H. pylori-induced gastric injury.

7799656|a|Liu Wei Di Huang Tang (LWDHT), a Chinese prescription for strengthening the body resistance, restoring the normal functions of the body to consolidate the constitution, and nourishing and invigorating the kidney yin, has been used to prevent and treat severe hyperplasia of esophageal epithelium for many years. The results of this experiment show that LWDHT can increase markedly the number of lymphocytes, mainly T lymphocytes, in tumor-bearing mice. Free-flow electrophoresis shows that in tumor-bearing mice the electrophoretic characteristics of T lymphocytes are changed, i.e., reduction of the number of T lymphocytes with a higher electrophoretic rate, but LWDHT can alleviate this disorder. Study on the cell membrane fluidity of carcinoma cells in EAC mice demonstrates that LWDHT can decrease the cell membrane fluidity, suggesting that it can inhibit division of carcinoma cells.

29311942|t|Yupingfeng San Inhibits NLRP3 Inflammasome to Attenuate the Inflammatory Response in Asthma Mice.
29311942|a|Yupingfeng San (YPFS) is a representative Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula with accepted therapeutic effect on Asthma. However, its action mechanism is still obscure. In this study, we used network pharmacology to explore potential mechanism of YPFS on asthma. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor pathway was shown to be the top one shared signaling pathway associated with both YPFS and asthma. In addition, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was treated as target protein in the process of YPFS regulating asthma. Further, experimental validation was done by using LPS-stimulated U937 cells and ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized BALB/c mice model. In vitro experiments showed that YPFS significantly decreased the production of TNF-alpha and IL-6, as well as both mRNA and protein levels of IL-1beta, NLRP3, Caspase-1 and ASC in LPS-stimulated U937 cells. In vivo experiment indicated that YPFS treatment not only attenuated the clinical symptoms, but also reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, mucus secretion and MUC5AC production in lung tissue of asthmatic mice. Moreover, YPFS treatment remarkably decreased the mRNA and protein levels of IL-1beta, NLRP3, Caspase-1 and ASC in lung tissue of asthmatic mice. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that YPFS could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome components to attenuate the inflammatory response in asthma.

24716117|t|The in vivo Therapeutic Effect of Free Wanderer Powder ( xiao yao san, Xiaoyaosan) on Mice with 4T1 Cell Induced Breast Cancer Model.
24716117|a|In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of a classical TCM formula, Free Wanderer Powder ( xiao yao san), in a breast cancer mouse model induced with estrogen-insensitive breast cancer 4T1 cells. Ovariectomized Balb/c mice (6-8 weeks) or sham mice were injected into the fourth mammary fat pad with 4T1 cells in which tumors were palpable 7 days after injection. On the eighth day, the mice were divided into 4 groups and tubefed daily with vehicle, Free Wanderer Powder ( xiao yao san) formula or tamoxifen for 28 days. Tumor growth inhibition and the decrease of the average tumor mass were most evident in mice treated with Free Wanderer Powder ( xiao yao san). Free Wanderer Powder ( xiao yao san) treatment significantly reduced Bcl-2 and elevated Bax and p53 protein expressions in breast cancer tumor. These results were further confirmed by immunohistochemisty. Tamoxifen could decrease spleen mass and Bcl-2 protein expression, increase the Bax protein expression as well as exert uterotrophic effects by increasing uterus index and inducing the gene expressions in the uterus. Taken together, these results show that Free Wanderer Powder ( xiao yao san) treatment induced apoptosis at protein level and inhibited the tumor growth in 4T1-induced ovariectomized Balb/c female mice, indicating the possibility of its future use for treatment of estrogen-insensitive breast caner.

27235019|t|The combination effects of Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu on promoting apoptosis of transplanted H22 hepatocellular carcinoma in mice receiving chemotherapy.
27235019|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu Powder (SLBZP) is a classic traditional Chinese medical formula that has been used for several decades in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. Whether SLBZP is best employed as single agent or adjunctive therapy has yet to be determined as does the mechanism whereby SLBZP exerts its anti-tumor effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effects of SLBZP alone and in combination with Cytoxan (CTX) on tumor growth, malignant cell apoptosis and Akt/Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-capital KA, CyrillicB) signaling in a murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four adult mice developed HCC following subcutaneous inoculation with H22 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Seven days later, all received chemotherapy with CTX (200mg/kg) once. Mice were then randomized into eight study groups (N=8/group). Three groups were treated with different concentrations of SLBZP alone (6.00, 3.00, 1.5g/kg), three with SLBZP (6.00, 3.00, 1.5g/kg) plus CTX (20mg/kg), one with CTX (20mg/kg) alone (positive control), and one with physiologic saline (untreated, negative control). All groups were treated for 14 days. Tumor size, histology and serum or tissue levels and/or mRNA expression of PDGF-BB, VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, NF-capital KA, CyrillicB, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2); B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL); X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), Survivin, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Caspase-7, Akt and phosphorylated Akt expression were documented at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Compared to untreated negative controls, tumor sizes were decreased in the CTX alone, SLBZP (M)+CTX and SLBZP (H)+CTX groups (-52%,-53% and -58% respectively). Tumor cell density was decreased in all treated groups but most apparent in the SLBZP (H)+CTX group. Electron microscopic evidence of apoptosis was also most apparent in this group. Serum and/or tissue levels and expression of PDGF-BB, VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, their downstream signaling proteins and anti-apoptotic markers were lowest and pro-apoptotic markers highest in SLBZP (H)+CTX treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: In this chemotherapy-induced animal model of HCC, SLBZP was most efficacious as adjunctive therapy and appears to act by inhibiting tumor growth promoters and anti-apoptotic proteins while enhancing pro-apoptotic proteins.

9185758|t|Effects of the Japanese herbal medicine "Sho-saiko-to" (TJ-9) on in vitro interleukin-10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with chronic hepatitis C.
9185758|a|"Sho-saiko-to" (TJ-9) consists of 7 herbal components. In Japan, it is widely prescribed to patients with chronic viral liver disease. TJ-9 is known to suppress liver cancer development and possess macrobiotic effects, but its mode of action is not fully understood. This study investigated the following: 1) cytokine production levels, mainly interleukin (IL)-10, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of chronic active hepatitis B and C patients, and healthy volunteers; 2) effects of TJ-9 on these productions; and 3) effects of each of its herb components on cytokine production in cell fractions. Results showed that without stimulants, IL-10 production in mononuclear cells of hepatitis B and C patients was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects (P < .01). IL-10 production induced by either phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM) in mononuclear cells of hepatitis C patients were significantly lower than in patients with hepatitis B (P < .01) and healthy subjects (P < .05). IL-10 production induced by anti-CD3 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was significantly lower than in healthy subjects (P < .05). The addition of TJ-9 to the cultures strongly induced IL-10, and this induction was mainly attributable to the effects of 2 components (scutellaria root and glycyrrhiza root) on the monocyte/macrophage fraction. The production of IL-4 and IL-5 in cultures with concanavalin A (conA) was significantly higher in patients with hepatitis C than in the healthy subjects (P < .01; P < .05), but the addition of TJ-9 suppressed these increases by 25% to 33% (P < .01). Therefore, TJ-9 could adjust the decreased IL-10 production and the increased IL-4 and IL-5 production of mononuclear cells from patients with hepatitis C. Moderate regulation of the cytokine production system in patients with hepatitis C by using TJ-9 may be useful in the prevention of disease progression.

34931459|t|HPLC-MS/MS based comparative pharmacokinetics of 12 bioactive components in normal and osteoporosis rats after oral administration of You-Gui-Wan.
34931459|a|You-Gui-Wan is a traditional Chinese patent medicine that has been extensively used to treat kidney-yang deficiency syndrome. An high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to measure contents of 12 components of You-Gui-Wan in rat plasma. Considering that pathological changes might directly affect the pharmacokinetic behavior of drugs, this method was further applied to compare pharmacokinetics between normal and osteoporotic animals. The results indicated that osteoporosis significantly altered the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the 12 components. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of You-Gui-Wan evaluated under osteoporotic conditions was much closer to clinical practice than that in normal physiological states. Thus, the optimized analytical method, along with the pharmacokinetic evaluation in the osteoporotic model may offer a more comprehensive understanding to elucidate the anti-osteoporosis mechanism of You-Gui-Wan. These findings may aid in developing a more effective treatment plan for osteoporosis.

35551974|t|An integrated approach for investigating pharmacodynamic material basis of Lingguizhugan Decoction in the treatment of heart failure.
35551974|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: As a classical formula of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Lingguizhugan Decoction (LGZGD) has been used for treating heart failure (HF) because it has an efficiency of yang-warming and fluid-dispersing. However, the pharmacodynamic material basis of LGZGD responsible for the therapeutic benefits is not well understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to elucidate the pharmacodynamic material basis of LGZGD by an integrated approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following oral administration of LGZGD in mice, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) was used to identify prototype substances. A heart failure (HF) model was established, followed by an untargeted metabolomics study to determine potential targets of LGZGD. The network pharmacology method was performed to screen substances that interacted with potential targets of LGZGD treating HF. Molecular docking technology was applied to further screen substances based on binding energy. Cell viability assays were conducted to verify pharmacodynamic effects of selected substances. RESULTS: In all, forty-two prototype substances were identified in the blood, urine, and fecal samples of mice. A total of fifty-five differential metabolites were identified using heart tissue untargeted metabolomics. Twenty-five substances of LGZGD were screened relating to thirty-three targets treating HF. Twenty-two substances were filtered according to their binding energy using molecular docking technology. Cell experiments revealed cinnamaldehyde, glycyrrhetinic acid, kaempferol, daidzein, caffeic acid, and catechin could significantly improve the survival rate of H9c2 cells, which might be the pharmacodynamic material basis of LGZGD. CONCLUSIONS: A scientific approach that integrated in vivo substances identification, metabolomics, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and cell pharmacodynamic assay has been developed to study the pharmacodynamic material basis of LGZGD in the treatment of HF.

17650789|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the toxicity-attenuation effect of Yiguan Decoction (YGD) in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with NP protocol of chemotherapy. METHODS: Ninety-two NSCLC patients were randomly assigned to two groups equally, the control group given only NP protocol of chemotherapy and the treated group given the same protocol of chemotherapy plus YGD. Hepatic function, T-cell subgroup and NK cell were examined, and quality of life (QOL) was evaluated with scoring by Karnofsky performance status (KPS), Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Special Scale for lung cancer (EORTC LC13) issued by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. RESULTS: The effects on all the above-mentioned indexes in the treated group were better than those in the control group after 42 days of treatment (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: YGD could not only reduce the side and toxic effects caused by NP protocol of chemotherapy in NSCLC patients but also improve their QOL.

26627190|t|Effect of the Chinese traditional prescription Suo Quan Wan on TRPV1 expression in the bladder of rats with bladder outlet obstruction.
26627190|a|BACKGROUND: Suo Quan Wan (SQW) is a Chinese traditional prescription that has been used in clinical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms for centuries. However, scientific basis of SQW efficacy and mechanism is still needed. This study investigated the effect of SQW on bladder function and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression in the bladder of rats with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). The induced changes in bladder function in overactive bladder (OAB) rat model were observed following different periods of outlet obstruction to obtain an appropriate rat model. METHODS: This study was carried out in two parts. In the first part, female Sprague-Dawley rats received sham operations or partial BOO operations. Two, four, and six weeks later, the OAB model groups and control were subjected to urodynamic tests to measure differences in bladder functions. Once the appropriate rat model was obtained, the second part of the experiment was performed. The rat model was recreated and treated with SQW. Urodynamic assessment was conducted, and the bladders of the rats were then removed. Immunofluorescence staining, real-time PCR, and Western blot were performed to localize and quantify the expression of TRPV1 in the bladder. RESULTS: Results of the first part indicated that at 2 and 4 weeks, the OAB model group exhibited significant differences in urodynamic parameters, including bladder pressure, maximum voiding pressure, and maximum bladder capacity, compared with the sham group. At 4 and 6 weeks, the OAB model group exhibited significant differences in residual volume (RV) and non-voiding contraction frequency. Six-week OAB model group showed much more RV but less voiding efficiency when compared with 6-week sham group or 2-and 4-week OAB model group. Rats that underwent BOO exhibited similarities with the compensated state before four weeks and may have entered decompensated state at six weeks. Studies conducted with 4-week OAB model were appropriate. In part two of the experiment, unstable bladder in the OAB model group recovered bladder stability after SQW treatment, accompanied by improved bladder hypertrophy, as well as corrected urodynamic parameters. Expression of TRPV1 mRNA and proteins in the bladder was significantly greater in the OAB model group than that in the control group, which subsequently decreased significantly with SQW treatment in BOO-induced rats. CONCLUSIONS: SQW can modulate the expression of TRPV1 in accordance with the recovery of bladder function.

9575480|t|Protective effects of Hange-shashin-to on water-immersion restraint stress-induced gastric ulcers.
9575480|a|Hange-shashin-to (HST) is a traditional Chinese herbal prescription (Banxia Xiexin Tang) which has long been used in the therapy of gastric functional disorders. In this report, the effect of HST extract on water-immersion restraint stress-induced gastric ulcer based on the changes in gastric mucin content and the variations of monoamine contents in hypothalamus were investigated. Ulcer index was microscopically measured by the sum total of the lengths of ulcers in glandular stomach. Gastric mucin content was determined by a PAS-staining methods and the monoamine contents were detected by HPLC-ECD method. HST extract was orally administered at 1, 2 and 3 g/kg for three consecutive days before stress exposure. Water-immersion restraint stress decreased the mucin content and produced gastric ulcers in a restraint time-dependent manner. Pretreatment with HST extract markedly inhibited the reduction of gastric mucin content and the development of gastric ulcer with significant differences (p < or = 0.01). The remarkable decrease of NE and 5-HT contents but prominent increases of MHPG and 5-HIAA contents were observed in hypothalamus after water-immersion restraint stress (p < or = 0.01). Those changes in monoamine contests in hypothalamus were also significantly inhibited by the pretreatment with HST extract at higher dosage (p < or = 0.05). These results indicate that the changes in gastric mucin content and the variation of monoamines in hypothalamus relate to the pathogenesis of water-immersion restraint stress-induced gastric ulcers, and it is suggested that the prophylactic effects of HST extract on stress induced gastric ulcers may be associated with an increase in gastric mucin content, although the prevention of HST extract on the extraordinary changes in monoamine contents in hypothalamus due to stress cannot be ruled out.

20738212|t|Protective effect of gan mai da zao decoction in unpredictable chronic mild stress-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations.
20738212|a|AIM: Growing evidence indicates that the glutamatergic system, especially the abnormalities of glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors contribute to the pathophysiology and possibly the pathogenesis of major depressive disorders. This study is to evaluate the effect of gan mai da zao (GMDZ) decoction on glutamate and NMDA receptor in unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sucrose preference test and open field test were used to estimate the depressive-like behaviors of UCMS rats. Glutamate levels and NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A and NR2B) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were determined by HPLC-FLD and by western-blot respectively. RESULTS: 32 days UCMS induced depressive-like behaviors, increased glutamate concentration and decreased NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats. However, NR1 expression remained constant in stressed rats compared with normal. The GMDZ decoction alleviated the depressive-like behavior, decreased glutamate level, and increased expression of NMDA receptor subunit NR2A and NR2B in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of stressed rats. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GMDZ treatment reversed chronic unpredictable stress-induced depressive-like behaviors in UCMS rats, possibly via reducing glutamate levels and increasing the NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B in frontal cortex and hippocampus.

24672944|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effect of Taohong Siwu Decoction (TSD) in regulating functions of endothelial cells and treating arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO). METHODS: The ASO model was prepared by using high-fat diet plus intimal injury. They were randomly divided into the model group (n = 10), the normal control group (n = 9), the low dose TSD group (group A, n = 12), the middle dose TSD group (group B, n = 10), and the high dose TSD group (group C, n = 9). Eight weeks after modeling, the limb blood perfusion was observed using laser Doppler flowmetry. The arterial morphology was observed using light microscope and transmission electron microscope. The number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) was determined using Percoll density gradient centrifugation method. Serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1, ET-1, and NO were detected using double antibody sandwich assay of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The ASO rat model was successfully established. Blood lipids levels significantly increased, the blood perfusion of left hind limbs significantly decreased, the number of CECs in the peripheral blood significantly increased, the arterial lumen was irregularly narrowed, the ultra-structure of vessel walls was damaged, serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1, and ET-1 significantly increased, and the serum level of NO significantly decreased in the model group, showing statistical difference when compared with the normal control group (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, significant improvement in the aforesaid indices was shown in group B and C (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The injury and abnormal functions of endothelial cells is an important pathological process of ASO. As an effective recipe for treating ASO, TSD could protect vascular endothelial cells and improve the secretion function of vascular endothelial cells.

23347961|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Da-Bu-Yin-Wan (DBYW) and Qian-Zheng-San (QZS), two traditional Chinese herbal formulas, were clinically employed to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) for decades. AIM OF THE STUDY: Our previous studies demonstrated neuroprotective effects of DBYW and QZS on mitochondrial function in mice model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). In present research, we aimed to investigate the possible neuroprotective mechanisms of DBYW and QZS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of DBYW and QZS on the behavioral changes (pole test), expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) of substantia nigra by immunohistochemistry, monoaminergic contents and activity of striatum by high performance liquid chromatography, neuronal ultrastructure changes by transmission electron microscopy, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage by long-extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and mRNA expression of mitochondrial subunit NADH dehydrogenase 1(ND1) by qualitative real-time PCR were investigated. RESULTS: Present study demonstrated that DBYW and QZS not only ameliorated the behavior induced by the administration of MPTP and synergistically prevented the decreasing of TH expression, but also increased monoaminergic contents and activity, improved the ultrastructural changes, decreased the mtDNA damage, and synergistically up-regulated the expression of ND1 in mRNA level. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DBYW and QZS possess anti-parkinsonism and neuroprotective properties.

15892284|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the toxicity attenuation and efficacy potentiation effects of Sijunzi decoction (SJZD) on bladder carcinoma treated by chemotherapy in mice. METHODS: T739 mice were randomly divided into 8 groups after subcutaneous inoculation of bladder carcinoma cells, the control group (A); two mitomycin C (MMC) group, treated with MMC of routine dosage (B) and low-dosage (C) respectively; three SJZD groups, treated with SJZD of high (D), medium (E) and low-dosage (F) respectively; and two combined treatment groups, treated with SJZD of high-dosage + MMC of routine dosage(G) and SJZD of high-dosage + MMC of low-dosage(H). The medication was begun at 24 hrs after inoculation. The tumor inhibitory rate, activity of peritoneal macrophages after 14 days of treatment and change of peripheral white blood cells after 7 days of treatment were determined and the survival time of mice was observed. RESULTS: The survival time of mice in Group D was significantly higher than that in Group A (P < 0.05), while those in Group E and F showed insignificant difference as compared with those in Group A (P > 0.05). The highest tumor inhibitory rate was shown in Group B, but the survival time in that group showed no significant difference as compared to those in Group A (P > 0.05). The longest survival time (32.7 +/- 1.3 days) was shown in Group H, which was obviously different to that in other groups (P < 0.05). And the leukocyte counts and macrophage activity in Group H were better than those in Group B, C and G (P < 0.05), except that the tumor inhibitory rate was significantly lower than that in Group B, C and G (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Combined chemotherapy of SJZD with low dosage MMC has definite effect in inhibiting tumor growth in mice with bladder carcinoma, displaying special effects of toxicity attenuation and efficacy potentiation.

23244755|t|A water extract of Samchulkunbi-tang attenuates airway inflammation by inhibiting inos and MMP-9 activities in an ovalbumin-induced murine asthma model.
23244755|a|BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the effect of Samchulkunbi-tang water extract (SCTE) in an established mouse model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma. The effects of SCTE on the production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, eotaxin, and total and OVA-specific immunoglobulin E, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity were measured. METHODS: Mice were sensitized on days 0 and 14 with an intraperitoneal injection of 20 mug ovalbumin (OVA) emulsified in 2 mg aluminum hydroxide in 200 muL PBS buffer. On days 21, 22, and 23, mice received an airway exposure to OVA (1%, w/v, in PBS) for 1 h. SCTE was administered orally to mice at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg per day from days 18 to 23. RESULTS: SCTE reduced the number of inflammatory cells, cytokines, and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and iNOS expression and MMP-9 activity in mouse lung tissue. Histological studies using hematoxylin & eosin and periodic acid-schiff staining showed that SCTE substantially inhibited OVA-induced inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue and goblet cell hyperplasia in the airway. SCTE also reduced IL-4 and IL-13 expression in concanavalin-A-stimulated splenocytes. These results were similar to those obtained with montelukast as a positive control. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that SCTE may be an effective oral treatment for allergic airway inflammation by virtue of its anti-inflammatory activity.

35365737|t|Molecular mechanisms of Huanglian jiedu decoction on ulcerative colitis based on network pharmacology and molecular docking.
35365737|a|Huanglian jiedu decoction (HLJDD) is a heat-clearing and detoxifying agent composed of four kinds of Chinese herbal medicine. Previous studies have shown that HLJDD can improve the inflammatory response of ulcerative colitis (UC) and maintain intestinal barrier function. However, its molecular mechanism is not completely clear. In this study, we verified the bioactive components (BCI) and potential targets of HLJDD in the treatment of UC using network pharmacology and molecular docking, and constructed the pharmacological network and PPI network. Then the core genes were enriched by GO and KEGG. Finally, the bioactive components were docked with the key targets to verify the binding ability between them. A total of 54 active components related to UC were identified. Ten genes are very important to the PPI network. Functional analysis showed that these target genes were mainly involved in the regulation of cell response to different stimuli, IL-17 signal pathway and TNF signal pathway. The results of molecular docking showed that the active components of HLJDD had a good binding ability with the Hub gene. This study systematically elucidates the "multi-component, multi-target, multi-pathway" mechanism of anti-UC with HLJDD for the first time, suggesting that HLJDD or its active components may be candidate drugs for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

34182475|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Xihuang Wan (XHW), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been used in China for a variety of cancers including lung cancer. The present study evaluated the efficacy of XHW on a Lewis lung mouse model and explored the potential mechanism via transcriptomics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mice were randomized into 6 groups: 1) untreated control (n=10); 2) low-dose XHW; 3) medium-dose XHW; 4) high-dose XHW; 5) cisplatin; and 6) untreated blank (n=4). Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected subcutaneously except for the 4 mice in the blank group. The body weight and tumor length and width were measured every 3 days. RNA-sequencing was performed on tumors in the high-dose XHW group and the control group. RESULTS: XHW inhibited the growth of LLC in a syngeneic mouse model, without toxicity, with equivalent efficacy to cisplatin. RNA-sequencing demonstrated that many signaling pathways were involved in XHW-mediated inhibition of LLC, including tumor necrosis factor, estrogen, cyclic guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate-protein kinase G, apelin and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: XHW inhibited LLC carcinoma through different pathways and shows clinical promise for patients who cannot tolerate platinum-based drugs.

31088684|t|Lipidomic analysis reveals therapeutic effects of Yijin-Tang on high-fat/high-cholesterol diet-induced obese mice.
31088684|a|BACKGROUND: In Traditional Korean and Chinese medicine, the herbal remedy Yijin (Erchen)-Tang (YJT) is widely used to treat obesity-related disorders, and its therapeutic potential has been demonstrated in numerous studies. However, the systemic effect of YJT on obesity status and change of lipid metabolism by YJT still remains unknown. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of the YJT on obesity by using lipidomics. METHODS: To evaluate the effects of treatment with YJT on obesity, C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFHC, 40% fat and 1% cholesterol) diet for 8 weeks and treated them with YJT for an additional 6 weeks. We then performed untargeted lipidomic analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry mass spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: YJT ameliorated obesity induced systemic inflammation and improved insulin resistance. Additionally, YJT protected against HFHC-diet-induced hepatic inflammation. To explore specific changes in lipid metabolism associated with the therapeutic effects of YJT, we performed untargeted lipid profiling of the plasma. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plots showed that YJT altered the lipid metabolic pattern of HFHC mice. In particular, ceramides and triglycerides with saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly changed by YJT, which were significantly associated with insulin resistance, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications and adipocytokine signaling pathway in pathway enrichment analysis. Thus, we analyzed the changes in adipocytes and adipokine caused by YJT, and confirmed that YJT alleviated adipocytes inflammation and macrophage infiltration, and reversed HFHC-induced alterations in leptin and adiponectin levels in adipose tissue and plasma. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that YJT ameliorates obesity-induced systemic inflammation and insulin resistance by regulating lipid metabolism, and demonstrated that lipidomic profiling is a useful method to investigate the therapeutic effects of herbal decoctions in traditional Korean and Chinese medicine.

34552344|t|The Effect of Shaoyao Gancao Decoction on Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction in Hypercholesterolemic Rabbits via Protecting the Enteric Nervous System-Interstitial Cells of Cajal-Smooth Muscle Cells Network.
34552344|a|OBJECTIVE: This study observes the morphological changes in the enteric nervous system (ENS) - interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) - smooth muscle cells (SMC) network in sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) in hypercholesterolemic rabbits following treatment with Shaoyao Gancao decoction (SGD), as well as the apoptosis of the ICC. METHODS: In this study, 48 healthy adult New Zealand rabbits are randomly divided into three groups (n = 16 in each group): the control, the model, and the SGD treatment groups. The hypercholesterolemic rabbit model is established. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining, immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction are used to detect the morphological changes in the ENS-ICC-SMC network, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in the ICC, and to observe the curative effect of SGD after treatment. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the morphology and the ultrastructure of the SO are destroyed in the model group. In addition, the protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5), nitric oxide (NO), the SMCs, and the ICC all significantly decreased while substance P (SP) significantly increased. Compared with the model group, the SO morphology and ultrastructure are repaired in the SGD group. In addition, the PGP9.5, NO, the SMCs, and the ICC significantly increased while SP decreased. In addition, SGD may activate the stem cell factor (SCF)/c-Kit signaling pathway to treat SO dysfunction by up-regulating the expression of c-Kit and SCF. Similarly, this pathway restores SO by up-regulating the expression of Bcl2 and inhibiting cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and the tumor necrosis factor.

32920136|t|Xianglian Pill ameliorates antibiotic-associated diarrhea by restoring intestinal microbiota and attenuating mucosal damage.
32920136|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xianglian Pill (XLP), a traditional Chinese pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment of gastrointestinal disease, possessing anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and analgesic activities, may represent a promising candidate for the treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to unravel the underlying mechanism of XLP on the amelioration of AAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AAD was induced by intragastric administration of a mixture of cefuroxime and levofoxacin (300 mg/kg. bw + 200 mg/kg. bw) for five consecutive days. Then AAD mice were treated with XLP at the dose of 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg. bw, respectively for 5 days. The physical manifestations, diarrhea status were monitored during the drug delivery. Histopathology of colon, intestinal microbiota, inflammatory cytokines, tight junction protein and short chain fat acids (SCFAs) were determined. RESULTS: Mice received cefuroxime and levofoxacin for 5 days developed medium to severe diarrhea. XLP treatment, however, mitigated the diarrhea status. Further evaluation revealed that XLP promoted the recovery of mucosa, maintained the integrity of tight junction, attenuated the inflammatory disorders, restored intestinal microbiota and increased SCFAs level in feces. CONCLUSION: XLP ameliorates AAD by restoring intestinal microbiota and attenuating mucosal damage.

30108656|t|Danggui Sini Decoction Protected Islet Endothelial Cell Survival from Hypoxic Damage via PI3K/Akt/eNOS Pathway.
30108656|a|Danggui Sini decoction (DSD) is a traditional Chinese decoction, which is wildly applied and showed to be effective in ameliorating ischemia-related symptoms. However, the mechanisms of DSD action in ischemic damage remain to be fully clarified. Pancreatic islet endothelial cells are pivotal constituent of islet microvasculature, with high vulnerability to hypoxic injuries. Here, using MST1 cell, a pancreatic islet endothelial cell-line, as a model, we investigated the effects of DSD on hypoxia-stimulated endothelial cell lesions and its underlying mechanisms. We found that DSD-Containing Serum (DSD-CS), collected from DSD-treated rats, could efficiently protect MST1 survival and proliferation from Cobalt chloride (CoCl2) induced damage, including cell viability, proliferation, and tube formation. Furthermore, DSD-CS restored the activity of PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling inhibited by CoCl2 in MST1 cells. The protective effect of DSD-CS could be blocked by the specific PI3K/Akt/eNOS inhibitor LY294002, suggesting that DSD-CS protection of MST1 cell survival from hypoxia was mediated by PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway. In conclusion, DSD treatment protected MST1 survival from hypoxic injuries via PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway, indicating its role in protecting microvascular endothelial cells.

31966790|t|BuyangHuanwu decoction (BYHWD) protects against retinal ischemic injury.
31966790|a|Severe ipsilateral or bilateral carotid artery stenosis or occlusion is the most common cause of ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS). This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of BuyangHuanwu decoction (BYHWD) against the retinal ischemia induced by ligation of carotid arteries in rats. The effects of BYHWD (0.64 g/kg, i.g.) on ischemia-induced retinal damage were examined with histological staining, RT-PCR and western blot. The protective effects of BYHWD on the ischemia retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) model induced by hypoxia were examined in vitro. The results indicated that BYHWD significantly prevented the decrease in density of cells in ganglion cell layer (GCL) and in the thickness of total retinal, and the increase in the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells. In addition, BYHWD decreased the expression of Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Bax, and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in retina after ischemia. Similar to the results in vivo, BYHWD significantly suppressed the hypoxia-induced changes of apoptosis related gene and protein expression. These findings suggest that BYHWD may prevent ischemia-induced retinal ischemia through its inhibition of apoptosis.

34966437|t|To Predict Anti-Inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Targets of Guizhi Decoction in Treating Asthma Based on Network Pharmacology, Molecular Docking, and Experimental Validation.
34966437|a|Asthma, characterized by the continuous inflammatory response caused by a variety of immune cells, is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases worldwide. Relevant clinical trials proved that the traditional Chinese medicine formula Guizhi Decoction (GZD) had multitarget and multichannel functions, which might be an effective drug for asthma. However, the effective ingredients and mechanisms of GZD against asthma are still unclear. Therefore, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and cell experiments were performed to explore the antiasthma effects and potential mechanisms of GZD. First, we applied the TCMSP database and literature to obtain the bioactivated ingredients in GZD. SwissTargetPrediction, TCMSP, GeneCards, OMIM, PharmGkb, TTD, DrugBank, and STRING database were used to get core genes. In addition, the key pathways were analyzed by the DAVID database. Molecular docking was used to predict whether the important components could act on the core target proteins directly. Finally, qPCR was carried out to verify the network pharmacology results and the possible mechanisms of GZD in the treatment of asthma. We collected 134 active ingredients in GZD, 959 drug targets, and 3223 disease targets. 431 intersection genes were screened for subsequent analysis. Through GO and KEGG analyses, enriched pathways related to inflammation and immune regulation were presented. Through the qPCR method to verify the role of essential genes, we found that GZD had an excellent anti-inflammatory effect. Direct or indirect inhibition of MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways might be one of the crucial mechanisms of GZD against asthma. GZD might be a promising potential drug for the treatment of asthma. This article provided a reference for the clinical application of GZD.

35104755|t|Integrated microbiome-metabolomics analysis reveals the potential therapeutic mechanism of Zuo-Jin-Wan in ulcerative colitis.
35104755|a|BACKGROUND: Dysregulation in gut microbiota and host cometabolome contributes to the complicated pathology of ulcerative colitis (UC), while Zuo-Jin-Wan (ZJW), a traditional Chinese medicine has shown therapeutic effects against UC with its underlying mechanism remains elusive. PURPOSE: This study utilized an integrated analysis combining gut microbiome and host cometabolism to disclose the potential therapeutic mechanism of ZJW on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in rats. METHODS: We first evaluated the therapeutic effects of ZJW treatment in DSS-induced rat model. 16S rRNA sequencing, (1)H NMR spectroscopy-based metabolomics and Spearman correlation analysis were conducted to explore the potential therapeutic mechanism during the treatment. RESULTS: Our results showed that UC symptoms in ZJW rats were significantly attenuated. Marked decline in microbial diversity in ZJW group was accompanied by its correspondent function adjustment. Specific enrichment of genus Bacteroides, Sutterella, Akkermansia and Roseburia along with the major varying amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism were observed meantime. Metabolic data further corroborated that ZJW-related metabolic changes were basically gathered in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate/energy metabolism and lipid metabolism. Of note, some biochemical parameters were deeply implicated with the discriminative microbial genera and metabolites involved in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and amino acid metabolism, indicating the microbiome-metabolome association in gut microbiota-metabolite-phenotype axis during UC treatment of ZJW. CONCLUSION: For the first time, integrated microbiome-metabolome analysis depicted that ZJW could alleviate DSS-induced UC in rats via a crosstalk between gut microbiota and host cometabolites.

34447315|t|Taohong Siwu Decoction Regulates Cell Necrosis and Neuroinflammation in the Rat Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Model.
34447315|a|Cell necrosis and neuroinflammation play an important role in brain injury induced by ischemic stroke. Previous studies reported that Taohong Siwu decoction (THSWD)can reduce heart muscle cell necrosis and has anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of THSWD on cell necrosis and neuroinflammation in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups with 12 rats in each group. They were the sham operation group, MCAO model group, and MCAO + THSWD group. We used ELISA to determine the levels of TNF-alpha, Mcp-1, and IL-1beta inflammatory factors in rat serum, qRT-PCR to detect the expression of TNF-alpha, Mcp-1 and IL-1beta mRNA in rat brain, and immunohistochemistry to detect the number of microglia and neutrophils in rat brain. qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of IBA-1 and MPO inflammatory factors and the TNF-alpha/RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway in the rat brain and protein expression levels. Compared with the sham operation group, the expression of MCP-1, IL-1beta, IBA-1, and MPO inflammatory factors and the TNF-alpha/RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway were significantly upregulated in the MCAO group. Compared with the MCAO group, the expressions of MCP-1, IL-1beta, IBA-1, and MPO inflammatory factors and the TNF-alpha/RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway were significantly downregulated in the MCAO + THSWD group. THSWD can reduce the expression levels of MCP-1, IL-1beta, IBA-1, and MPO inflammatory factors as well as the TNF-alpha/RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway. Meanwhile, it can reduce the necrosis and inflammation of brain cells after cerebral ischemia, so as to protect the brain tissue of rats.

The chronic unpredictable mild stress(CUMS) model of depression was induced in the model group, the Bupleuri Radix group, the Paeoniae Radix Alba group, the herb-pair group(Bupleuri Radix-Paeoniae Radix Alba), the Sini Powder group, and the vinegar-processed Sini Powder group(Bupleuri Radix and Paeoniae Radix Alba were vinegar-processed). After the establishment of the model, the rats in each group were continuously administered with corresponding drugs(ig) at a dose of 9.6 g.kg~(-1) for eight days [the rats in the model group and the normal group(without model induction) received the same volume of normal saline at the same time]. Following the last administration, the differential metabolites were identified to analyze metabolic pathways based on the rat plasma samples collected from each group. A total of sixteen potential biomarkers were identified. The metabolites with significant changes were involved in many biological metabolic pathways, such as amino acid metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, glycerol phospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and purine metabolism. After drug intervention, some biomarkers returned to normal levels. Further comparisons of processing and compatibility revealed that the vinegar-processed Sini Powder group had the most total metabolic pathways where differential metabolites were returned to normal. Compared with the individual herbs, the herb-pair significantly improved the recovery of differential metabolites in the pentose phosphate and purine metabolic pathways. Compared with the Sini Powder, the vinegar-processed Sini Powder facilitated the recovery of differential metabolites in the arginine biosynthesis, and pyrimidine and pentose phosphate metabolic pathways. As indicated by the results, Sini Powder may interfere with depression by regulating lipid and nucleotide metabolisms. The processing and compatibility of Chinese herbal medicines can potentiate the intervention on depression by regulating nucleotide, energy, and amino acid metabolisms to a certain extent.

19260319|t|[Effect of effective components of huanglian jiedu decoction on hypoxia, reoxygenation injury and the expression of VCAM in cultured rat cerebral microvascular endothelial cells].
19260319|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective mechanism of geniposide, baicalin and berberine on hypoxia and reoxygenation injury in cultured rat cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. METHOD: A model of four hours hypoxia and twelve hours reoxygenation injury in rat cerebral microvascular endothelial cells in vitro was established. The injured cells were treated with geniposide (0.128, 0.064, 0.032 mmol x L(-1)), baicalin (0.028, 0.014, 0.007 mmol L(-1)) and berberine (0.024, 0.012, 0.006 mmol L(-1)), respectively. The immunocytochemical method and techniques of image quantitative analysis were used to detect the mean optical density and mean area in order to match the protein expression of VCAM-1. The method of RT-PCR was adopted to observe and match the mRNA expression of VCAM-1. RESULT: As compared with the normal group, the mean optical density, the mean area and the mRNA expression of VCAM-1 of model group were significant increased (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.01). As compared with the model group, both the mean optical density and the mean area of all treated groups were decreased, and there was significant difference between them (P < 0.01, P < 0.01). As compared with normal group, the mean optical density of baicalin (0.007 mmol x L(-1)) and berberine (0.012, 0.006 mmol x L(-1)) were significant decreased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between the other groups and the normal group. As compared with normal group, the mean area of baicalin (0.0014 mmol x L(-1)) was significant decreased (P < 0.05), but there was significant difference between the other groups and the normal group. The mRNA expression of all treated groups was not only lower than that of the model group but also higher than that of the normal group (P < 0.05, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that geniposide, baicalin and berberine, which are effective compositions of huanglian jiedu decoting, can protect hypoxia-reoxygenation injuried rat cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. One of the protected mechanisms is that they can inhibit the expression of VCAM-1.

27558312|t|Yu Ping Feng San reverses cisplatin-induced multi-drug resistance in lung cancer cells via regulating drug transporters and p62/TRAF6 signalling.
27558312|a|Yu Ping Feng San (YPFS), an ancient Chinese herbal decoction composed of Astragali Radix, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma and Saposhnikoviae Radix, has been used in the clinic for treating immune deficiency. In cancer therapy, YPFS is being combined with chemotherapy drugs to achieve improved efficacy; however, scientific evidence to illustrate this combination effect is lacking. The present study aims to demonstrate the anti-drug resistance of YPFS in cisplatin (DDP)-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549/DDP). The application of YPFS exhibited a synergistic enhancement of DDP-induced cytotoxicity as well as of the apoptotic signalling molecules. DDP-induced expression of the multi-drug-resistance efflux transporters was markedly reduced in the presence of YPFS, resulting in a higher intracellular concentration of DDP. In addition, the application of YPFS increased DDP-induced ROS accumulation and MMP depletion, decreased p62/TRAF6 signalling in DDP-treated A549/DDP cells. The co-treatment of DDP and YPFS in tumour-bearing mice reduced the tumour size robustly (by more than 80%), which was much better than the effect of DDP alone. These results indicate that YPFS can notably improve the DDP-suppressed cancer effect, which may be a consequence of the elevation of intracellular DDP via the drug transporters as well as the down regulation of p62/TRAF6 signalling.

18184544|t|[Effect of Sijunzi Decoction and enteral nutrition on T-cell subsets and nutritional status in patients with gastric cancer after operation: a randomized controlled trial].
18184544|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of perioperative application of Sijunzi Decoction and enteral nutrition on T-cell subsets and nutritional status in patients with gastric cancer after operation. METHODS: In this prospective, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial, fifty-nine patients with gastric cancer were randomly divided into three groups: control group (n=20) and two study groups (group A, n=21; group B, n=18). Sjunzi Decoction (100 ml) was administered via nasogastric tube to the patients in the study group B from the second postoperation day to the 9th postoperation day. Patients in the two study groups were given an isocaloric and isonitrogonous enteral diet, which was started on the second day after operation, and continued for eight days. Patients in the control group were given an isocaloric and isonitrogonous parenteral diet for 9 days. All variables of nutritional status such as serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA), transferrin (TRF) and T-cell subsets were measured one day before operation, and one day and 10 days after operation. RESULTS: All the nutritional variables and the levels of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD4(+)/CD8(+) were decreased significantly after operation. Ten days after operation, T-cell subsets and nutritional variables in the two study groups were increased as compare with the control group. The levels of ALB, TRF and T-cell subsets in the study group B were increased significantly as compared with the study group A (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Enteral nutrition assisted with Sijunzi Decoction can positively improve and optimize cellular immune function and nutritional status in the patients with gastric cancer after operation.

24337676|t|Gene expression profiling of lens tumors, liver and spleen in alpha-crystallin/SV40 T antigen transgenic mice treated with Juzen-taiho-to.
24337676|a|The autogenic lens tumors induced by the Simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) T antigen in alpha-crystallin/SV40 T antigen transgenic (TG) mice, provide a tool to screen anti-tumor reagents in vivo and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Juzen-taiho-to, a Chinese medicine composed of 10 herbs, was frequently used as an alternative medicine for cancer patients by clinicians and occasionally it was demonstrated to have beneficial effects on the prognosis and general condition of cancer patients. However, it was not scientifically verified. In the present study, the anti-tumor effects and underlying mechanisms of Juzen-taiho-to in the TG mice model was examined using cDNA microarray analysis and the results were confirmed by real-time PCR. The TG mice demonstrated a higher cumulative survival rate after treatment with the drug compared with the control group (P<0.05). Gene chip profiles demonstrated that cell functions involving the membrane, glycoprotein, cell membrane, signal and ionic channel for the lens tumor, the cell cycle, DNA replication, homeobox, mitosis and cell division for the spleen and the acetylation, mitochondrion, ribosomal protein, ribonucleoprotein for the liver, were altered by the administration of Juzentaiho-to. The important canonical pathways were those of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the cell cycle and the ribosome for the altered genes of the lens tumor, spleen and liver after drug administration, respectively. From real-time PCR, in the eyeball, epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr), Rasgrf1 and heat shock protein 1B (Hspa1b) mRNAs were found to be significantly lower in treated lenses than in those not exposed to the drug, while Rps25 mRNA demonstrated the opposite association in the liver. It was suggested that Juzen-taiho-to may prolong the survival time of SV40 T antigen TG mice by improving their nutritional condition, inhibiting the MAPK pathway and strengthening the immune system without causing hepatic toxicity.

27267777|t|Global and Targeted Metabolomics Evidence of the Protective Effect of Chinese Patent Medicine Jinkui Shenqi Pill on Adrenal Insufficiency after Acute Glucocorticoid Withdrawal in Rats.
27267777|a|Glucocorticoids are commonly used in anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies, but glucocorticoid withdrawal can result in life-threatening risk of adrenal insufficiency. Chinese patented pharmaceutical product Jinkui Shenqi pill (JKSQ) has potent efficacy on clinical adrenal insufficiency resulting from glucocorticoid withdrawal. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. We used an animal model to study JKSQ-induced metabolic changes under adrenal insufficiency and healthy conditions. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with hydrocortisone for 7 days with or without 15 days of JKSQ pretreatment. Sera were collected after 72 h hydrocortisone withdrawal and used for global and free fatty acids (FFAs)-targeted metabolomics analyses using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Rats without hydrocortisone treatment were used as controls. JKSQ pretreatment normalized the significant changes of 13 serum metabolites in hydrocortisone-withdrawal rats, involving carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids. The most prominent effect of JKSQ was on the changes of FFAs and some [product FFA]/[precursor FFA] ratios, which represent estimated desaturase and elongase activities. The opposite metabolic responses of JKSQ in adrenal insufficiency rats and normal rats highlighted the "Bian Zheng Lun Zhi" (treatment based on ZHENG differentiation) guideline of TCM and suggested that altered fatty acid metabolism was associated with adrenal insufficiency after glucocorticoid withdrawal and the protective effects of JKSQ.

34513708|t|Exploration of the Potential Mechanism of Tao Hong Si Wu Decoction for the Treatment of Breast Cancer Based on Network Pharmacology and In Vitro Experimental Verification.
34513708|a|BACKGROUND: Tao Hong Si Wu Decoction (THSWD) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used clinically alone or combined with drugs to treat breast cancer. However, there has been no study to date on the underlying mechanisms of its therapeutic effects. OBJECTIVES: To explore the potential mechanism of THSWD for the treatment of breast cancer using network pharmacology and experimental research. METHODS: The active ingredients of THSWD were screened according to Lipinski's rule of five based on the 107 ingredients of THSWD identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS(E). The targets of THSWD and breast cancer from multiple databases were collected, and a Compound-Target-Pathway network based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) was constructed. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were performed via the DAVID server. Molecular docking studies verified the selected key ingredients and key targets. The results of network pharmacology were verified by in vitro experiments. Including the effects of THSWD drug-containing rat serum (THSWD serum) on cell proliferation, and on the targets HRAS, MAPK1, AKT1, GRB2, and MAPK14 were assayed by RT-qPCR and Western blot assays. RESULTS: In total, 27 active ingredients including 8 core components, were obtained from 107 ingredients and 218 THSWD target genes for the treatment of breast cancer were identified. THSWD is active in the treatment of breast cancer by targeting Ras, FoxO, PI3K-Akt and other signaling pathways. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation was inhibited by THSWD serum in a time and concentration dependent manner. THSWD could regulated the RNA and protein expression of core targets HRAS, MAPK1, AKT1, GRB2, and MAPK14 for treatment of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: The results of network pharmacology study showed that THSWD is active against breast cancer by intervening with multiple targets and pathways. Luteolin, kaempferol, senkyunolide E, and other 8 compounds may be the core active ingredients of THSWD in the treatment of breast cancer. THSWD treatment of breast cancer may be related to targeting Ras, FoxO, PI3K-Akt, and other signal pathways associated with the core targets HRAS, MAPK1, AKT1, GRB2, and MAPK14.

34914218|t|[Xihuang Pills and its main components inhibit PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways and promote the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice].
34914218|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Xihuang Pills (XHP) and its main components on PI3K, AKT and mTOR signaling pathways and cell apoptosis of castration-resistant human PCa PC-3 cell subcutaneously transplanted tumors in nude mice. METHODS: We assigned 36 PC-3 tumor-bearing model mice to six groups of equal numbers to be treated with XHP, musk, calculus bovis (CB), musk + CB and docetaxel, respectively. After 14 days of intervention, we calculated the tumor-inhibition rate in different groups, observed the morphology of the tumor cells by HE staining, determined the levels of PI3K, Akt and mTOR mRNA by RT-qPCR, and determined the expressions of PI3K, Akt and mTOR signaling pathways and caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteins by Western blot. RESULTS: After 14 days of medication, the tumor-inhibition rates in the XHP, musk, CB, musk + CB and docetaxel groups were 29.67%, 5.52%, 7.26%, 12.88% and 6.26%, respectively. HE staining showed the formation of apoptotic bodies in the tumor tissues after intervention, especially in the XHP and musk + CB groups. The mRNA and phosphorylated protein expressions of PI3K, Akt and mTOR were significantly down-regulated (P < 0.01), and so were the expressions of caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteins in the XHP and musk + CB groups in comparison with the control (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Xihuang Pills, musk and calculus bovis can inhibit the growth of castration-resistant human PCa PC-3 cell subcutaneously transplanted tumors, which is associated with their effects of suppressing the abnormally activated PI3K, Akt and mTOR signaling pathways and promoting the apoptosis of PCa PC3 cells.

16313118|t|[Protective effect of zuogui pill on ovarian autoimmune injury].
16313118|a|OBJECTIVE: To probe the effect of Zuogui pill (ZGP), a Chinese compound recipe for tonifying Shen, on ovarian function in mice with premature ovarian failure (POF). METHODS: BALB/C female mice model of POF was established by multiple sites subcutaneous injection of ovarian antigen elicited with ovarian tissue of SD female rats, and treated with ZGP at different time points in the modeling, with prednisone as positive control. The levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2) in peripheral blood were measured with radioimmunoassay, and ovarian antibody (AoAb) was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA expression of ovarian growth and differentiation factor-9 was detected with in situ hybridization. RESULTS: POF model mice manifested such abnormalities as increased FSH, decreased E2, and positive AoAb in peripheral blood, with lymphocytes infiltration in ovarian mesanchyma, reduction of GDF-9 mRNA positive oocytes, and decrease of growing and mature follicles. ZGP could reduce the increase of FSH, increase the level of E2, inhibit the production of AoAb, raise the GDF-9 mRNA positive cells of oocytes, increase the number of growing and mature follicles. The clinical efficacy was more significant in early stage than in advanced stage. CONCLUSION: ZGP can improve immune inflammatory injury of ovary, and shows therapeutic effect on POF.

18808624|t|A traditional Chinese herbal medicine used to treat dysmenorrhoea among Taiwanese women.
18808624|a|AIM: The purposes of this study were twofold, firstly to ascertain the relative effectiveness of the alternative drug, Si-Wu-Tang (SWT), for dysmenorrhoea treatment and secondly to compare two different timings for consumption of SWT in terms of menstrual pain. DESIGN: A two-group time series experimental design. METHODS: A total of 49 participants were alternately assigned into two study groups. The experimental group was provided with 15 g of SWT daily for seven consecutive days, subsequent to the cessation of menstrual bleeding, for two consecutive menstrual cycles and the comparison group was provided with a similar intervention as soon as menstrual bleeding was noted. The degree of menstrual pain was recorded daily using a visual analogue scale and the duration of pain was also recorded during menstrual bleeding for five consecutive menstrual cycles. RESULTS: The results indicated that the decrease in menstrual pain levels and the duration of pain between the experimental group and the comparison group was not significant. However, the decrease in menstrual pain over the five menstrual cycles within the experimental group (from 2.07 to 1.42; 2.71 to 1.21; p < 0.05) and within the comparison group (from 1.94 to 1.23; 2.66 to 1.68; p < 0.05) were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The SWT formula has been continuously standardised for effective use as part of menstrual health and can be integrated as an alternative therapy within Western medicine. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study provides information for health care professionals not only about the general principles of traditional Chinese medicine, but also about the selection and consumption of an appropriate SWT formula among Asian women with dysmenorrhoea. Moreover, nurses should build up a partnership with their clients of Asian origins based on the use of an alternative therapy using different assessment criteria that are related to healing and recovery based on bodily constitution balance.

21333722|t|Hepatoprotective effects of Yi Guan Jian, an herbal medicine, in rats with dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver fibrosis.
21333722|a|AIMS OF THE STUDY: Yi Guan Jian (YGJ) has long been employed clinically to treat liver fibrosis in traditional Chinese Medicine but the mechanism underlying the regulation has not been clarified in detail. The present investigation was designed to assess the involvement of the fibrosis pathway in dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liver fibrosis was induced by DMN injection (10mg/kg, i.p., given three consecutive days each week) following 4 weeks. YGJ was oral administered (1.8 g/kg daily via gastrogavage for two weeks). Liver sample were subjected to histological and western blot studies. For evaluation of hepatic fibrosis-related factors, collagen alpha1-I, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) mRNA and protein levels were analyzed. RESULTS: YGJ remarkably prevented body weight loss and DMN damage in the liver, and it inhibited the elevation of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT). Oral administration of YGJ extract significantly reduced the accumulation of collagen alpha1-I, TIMP-1, and alpha-SMA in liver tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings indicate that the YGJ Chinese herb showed hepatoprotective and anti-fibrogenic effects against DMN-induced hepatic injury. Our data suggest that the YGJ may be useful in reversing the development of hepatic fibrosis.

23840732|t|Huang-lian-jie-du-tang protects rats from cardiac damages induced by metabolic disorder by improving inflammation-mediated insulin resistance.
23840732|a|Huang-lian-jie-du-tang (HLJDT), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to improve insulin resistance (IR) induced by inflammation, a key event in the development of metabolic syndrome (MS). The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of HLJDT on MS and explore the underlying mechanism. MS rats were established with obese-diets and treated with normal saline, aspirin or HLJDT. The myocardial lesions were identified by echocardiogram, transmission electron microscope, and Sirius-red staining. The inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA and real-time PCR. The activation of NF-kappaB, JNK, SOCS3, IRS1 and AKT in the heart was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Compared with the controls, MS rats developed obvious obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, IR, inflammation, and cardiac damage. Moreover, phosphorylated IRS-1 at Ser307 was correlated with the activation of NF-kappaB, JNK and SOCS3 and the inhibition of AKT in the heart from MS rats. These data suggest that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to inflammation is mediated, in part, by NF-kappaB, JNK and SOCS3. Notably, HLJDT inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB and reduced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. In summary, HLJDT protects myocardium from IR-mediated injury by inhibiting serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in MS rats.

24972579|t|Xiayuxue Decoction ([symbols; see text]) attenuates hepatic stellate cell activation and sinusoidal endothelium defenestration in CCl4-induced fibrotic liver of mice.
24972579|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ancient Chinese medical formula Xiayuxue Decoction ([symbols; see text], XYXD) on activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and defenestration of sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) in CCl4-induced fibrotic liver of mice. METHODS: High performance liquid chromatography was used to identify the main components of XYXD and control the quality of extraction. C57BL/6 mice were induced liver fibrosis by CCl4 exposure and administered with XYXD for 6 weeks simultaneously. Liver tissue was investigated by hematoxylin-eosin and Sirius-red staining. Sinusoidal fenestrations were observed by scanning electronic microscopy and fluorescent immunohistochemistry of PECAM-1 (CD31). Whole liver lysates were detected of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and type-I collagen by Western blot. Primary rat HSCs-T6 cells were analyzed by detecting alpha-SMA, F-actin, DNA fragmentation through confocal microscopy, Western blot, terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and cellomics arrayscan, respectively. RESULTS: Amygdalin and emodin in XYXD were identified. XYXD (993 mg/kg) inhibited Sirius red positive area up to 70.1% (P<0.01), as well as protein levels of alpha-SMA and type-I collagen by 42.0% and 18.5% (P<0.05) respectively. In vitro, XYXD (12.5 mug/mL, 50 mug/mL) suppressed the activation of HSCs and reversed the myofibroblastic HSCs into quiescent, demonstrated as inhibition of fluorescent F-actin by 32.3% and 46.6% (P<0.05). Besides, XYXD induced the apoptosis of HSC-T6 cells by 20.0% (P<0.05) and 49.5% (P<0.01), evidenced by enhanced TUNEL positivity. Moreover, ultrastructural observation suggested XYXD inhibited defenestration of SECs, which was confirmed by 31.1% reduction of protein level of CD31 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: XYXD inhibited both HSCs activation and SECs defenestration which accompany chronic liver injuries. These data may help to understand the underlying mechanisms of XYXD for prevetion of chronic liver diseases.

27485320|t|Immunomodulatory effects of Longdan Xiegan Tang on CD4+/CD8+ T cells and associated inflammatory cytokines in rats with experimental autoimmune uveitis.
27485320|a|Longdan Xiegan Tang (LXT) is a mixture of herbal extracts commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine that may exert immunomodulatory effects for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. However, the detailed mechanisms that mediate the actions of LXT are unclear. The present study induced an experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) model in Lewis rats via injection of IRBP11771191 emulsion. The model was used to investigate the effects of LXT on EAU rats and assess the efficacy of LXT by measuring clinical manifestations and histopathological changes caused by EAU. Additionally, alterations in the ratio of CD4+/CD8+T cells were determined by flow cytometry, and the expression of interferon (IFN)gamma, interleukin (IL)17, IL10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha were measured using reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay analysis. The results of the present study demonstrate that LXT can efficiently alleviate the symptoms of EAU, inhibit the differentiation of uveitogenic CD4+ T cells and reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFNgamma, IL17 and TNFalpha. Furthermore, LXT promotes the production of IL10 and accelerates the recovery of EAU, indicating that the immunomodulatory effects of LXT may potentially be used for the treatment of uveitis.

35002223|t|Identification of Active Ingredients of Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction for Promoting Nerve Function Recovery After Ischemic Stroke Using HT22 Live-Cell-Based Affinity Chromatography Combined with HPLC-MS/MS.
35002223|a|OBJECTIVE: The Chinese medicine Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction (HGWD) has been reported to improve the clinical symptoms and restore nerve function after ischemic stroke; however, its active ingredients are not well-determined. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the bioactive compounds of HGWD and explore the possible mechanism of action. METHODS: The methods, including live HT22 cells, solid-phase extraction, and HPLC-MS/MS were utilized. The potential ingredients were identified through comparisons with literature and monomer compounds. Then, oxygen-glucose deprivation reperfusion (OGD/R)-treated HT22 cells were utilized to investigate the effect of HGWD components with specific binding affinities. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and Tunel staining were used as testing indexes to analyze the protective effects of potential active ingredients on OGD/R-induced damage. RESULTS: Eleven compounds with specific binding affinities were identified as calycosin-7-O-glucoside, calycosin, formononetin, cinnamic alcohol, cinnamic acid, betaine, dl-2-phenylpropionic acid, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 6-methylcoumarin, wogonin, and paeoniflorin. Among them, six compounds had a protective effect on OGD/R-treated HT22 cells. Furthermore, calycosin-7-O-glucoside, calycosin, paeoniflorin, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, wogonin, and formononetin could regulate oxidative stress and apoptosis to attenuate the cell damage caused by OGD/R. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of action of HGWD to promote neurological recovery after ischemic stroke was related to the regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis. This study suggested that cell membrane affinity chromatography combined with HPLC-MS/MS could be applied to screen potential active components in traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).

VVC was induced in mice except the control group. After the modeling, administration began and lasted 7 days. The ge-neral conditions and body weight of mice were recorded every day. On the 1 st, 3 rd, 7 th, and 14 th after vaginal infection by Candida albicans, the fungal load in the vaginal lavage fluid of the mice was measured with the plate method, and the morphology of C. albicans in vaginal lavage fluid was observed based on Gram staining. After the mice were killed, vaginal tissues were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining and periodic acid-Schiff(PAS) staining for vaginal histopathological analysis. The content of cytokines in vaginal lavage fluid, such as interleukin(IL)-1beta, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), IL-6, and S100 a8, was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA), and content of reactive oxygen species(ROS) in vaginal tissues by tissue ROS detection kit. The protein expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, Dectin-1, Syk, MyD88, TLR2, TLR4, and nuclear factor-kappaB(NF-kappaB) in vaginal tissues was detected by Western blot, and the levels and distribution of NLRP3, Dectin-1, Syk, MyD88, TLR2, and TLR4 in vaginal tissues were determined with the immunohistochemical method. The results show that BAEB can improve the general conditions of VVC mice, reduce the fungal load and C. albicans hyphae in vaginal secretion, decrease ROS content in vaginal tissues and content of cytokines in vaginal lavage fluid, and down-regulate the expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, Dectin-1, Syk, MyD88, TLR2, TLR4, and NF-kappaB in vaginal tissues. The above results indicate that BAEB exerts therapeutic effect on VVC mice by down-regulating the key proteins in the TLRs/MyD88 and Dectin-1/Syk signal pathways and NLRP3 inflammasome.

27678361|t|Effects of Lizhong Tang on gastrointestinal motility in mice.
27678361|a|AIM: To investigate the effects of Lizhong Tang, a traditional Chinese medicine formula, on gastrointestinal motility in mice. METHODS: The in vivo effects of Lizhong Tang on GI motility were investigated by measuring the intestinal transit rates (ITRs) and gastric emptying (GE) values in normal mice and in mice with experimentally induced GI motility dysfunction (GMD). RESULTS: In normal ICR mice, the ITR and GE values were significantly and dose-dependently increased by Lizhong Tang (ITR values: 54.4% +/- 1.9% vs 65.2% +/- 1.8%, P < 0.01 with 0.1 g/kg Lizhong Tang and 54.4% +/- 1.9% vs 83.8% +/- 1.9%, P < 0.01 with 1 g/kg Lizhong Tang; GE values: 60.7% +/- 1.9% vs 66.8% +/- 2.1%, P < 0.05 with 0.1 g/kg Lizhong Tang and 60.7% +/- 1.9% vs 72.5% +/- 1.7%, P < 0.01 with 1 g/kg Lizhong Tang). The ITRs of the GMD mice were significantly reduced compared with those of the normal mice, which were significantly and dose-dependently reversed by Lizhong Tang. Additionally, in loperamide- and cisplatin-induced models of GE delay, Lizhong Tang administration reversed the GE deficits. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Lizhong Tang may be a novel candidate for development as a prokinetic treatment for the GI tract.

31031621|t|(1)H NMR-Based Metabolomics Reveals Refined-Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (BBG) as a Potential Ischemic Stroke Treatment Drug With Efficacy and a Favorable Therapeutic Window.
31031621|a|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to treat ischemic stroke. However, the complexity of its chemical composition makes quality control difficult. Berberine, baicalin, and geniposide are the three main ingredients in HLJDD. Here, a formula of BBG comprised of berberine, baicalin, and geniposide, known as Refined-Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction, was investigated for its efficacy, therapeutic window, and mechanisms of action. BBG was assessed on two major types of ischemic stroke, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and continuous ischemia injury, respectively. BBG showed efficacy comparable to HLJDD in the treatment of cerebral I/R injury within 5 h after injury initiation but did poorly in treating continuous ischemia injury. BBG exhibited neuroprotective effects on cerebral I/R injury by regaining the balance in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism, inflammation, and nucleic acid metabolism. These results suggested that BBG could be a good alternative to HLJDD, with high efficacy and a long therapeutic window, which shows great potential for drug development to treat stroke.

34970325|t|Research on the Protective Effect of MiR-185-3p Mediated by Huangqin-Tang Decoction (HQT) on the Epithelial Barrier Function of Ulcerative Colitis.
34970325|a|INTRODUCTION: It has been reported that the traditional Chinese medicine Huangqin-Tang decoction (HQT) has a protective effect on the epithelial barrier function of ulcerative colitis, but its mechanism has not been fully clarified. This study intends to explore the protective mechanism of HQT in regulating microRNA (miRNA) for the first time. METHODS: Based on the Balb/c mice ulcerative colitis model, the mice were given a gavage of 0.1 mL/10 g HQT every day for 7 days; on the 8th day, the colon of the mice was dissected, the length of the colon for the mice was measured, and the score was given based on this. Analysis of colonic mucosal injury was conducted by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Then, the differential miRNA was screened and sequenced in colon tissue using the HiSeq platform. And the differential miR-185-3p gene was verified by RT-PCR. Finally, the effects of HQT on miR-185-3p, occludin protein expression, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value were observed in combination with the CaCo2 intestinal epithelial cell model. RESULTS: HQT treatment can alleviate the shortening of colon length and reverse the intestinal mucosal injury. miRNA sequencing of colonic tissue showed that miR-185-3p was significantly downregulated in the model group, while HQT could upregulate miR-185-3p, thereby affecting the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)/myosin light chain phosphorylation (p-MLC) pathway and leading to increased expression of occludin protein, which ultimately protected the intestinal epithelial barrier function. CONCLUSION: HQT can protect colon epithelial barrier function by regulating miR-185-3p.

33149755|t|The Mechanisms of Sijunzi Decoction in the Treatment of Chronic Gastritis Revealed by Network Pharmacology.
33149755|a|Chronic gastritis is characterized by inflammation in the gastric mucosa with a vicious circle in inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators. Stomach adenocarcinoma would occur in the metaplastic gastric mucosa of chronic gastritis. Sijunzi decoction is a famous classical formula for the treatment of chronic gastritis. Although previous studies revealed some functions of Sijunzi decoction in treating chronic gastritis, the underlying mechanisms have not been illustrated clearly. In this study, we used network pharmacology to investigate the mechanism of Sijunzi decoction in treating chronic gastritis. Firstly, online datasets TCMSP, SWISS, and DisGeNET were used to investigate the functional mechanism of Sijunzi decoction against chronic gastritis and 18 genes were identified as targets of Sijunzi decoction in chronic gastritis. These 18 genes can be categorized into immunologically related genes and cancer-related genes. GO analysis showed that the 18 target genes were mainly enriched in angiogenesis, nitric oxide biosynthetic process, ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, cellular response to drug, and MAPK cascade. So, Sijunzi decoction alleviated chronic gastritis by inhibiting the local inflammatory response. Furthermore, we also investigated the impact of Sijunzi decoction on the peripheral blood leukocytes with our own RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of 11 chronic superficial gastritis patients. 102 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing RNA-seq data of chronic superficial gastritis patients with healthy control groups. After performing a functional analysis on 102 DEGs and Sijunzi decoction potential targets and taking the intersection of these pathways, we found that platelet activation, angiogenesis, and pathways in cancer were candidate target pathways regulated by Sijunzi decoction. Thus, Sijunzi decoction also alleviates chronic gastritis by suppressing inflammatory response of peripheral blood leukocytes. Our results showed that Sijunzi decoction can ameliorate the local gastric inflammation and inflammations in peripheral blood leukocytes and might also reduce the incidence of stomach cancer in chronic gastritis.

32242389|t|Danggui Buxue Tang ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats through inhibiting transforming growth factor-beta1/Smad3/ plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 signaling pathway.
32242389|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT), a decoction from Traditional Chinese Medicine, on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats, and to propose the possible underlying mechanism. METHODS: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham group, model group, prednisone group and DBT group. Pulmonary fibrosis rat model was established by intratracheal injection with bleomycin. Body weight and lung index were monitored. Histopathologic examination and collagen deposition were determined using Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson's trichrome staining. Immunohistochemistry staining was applied to observe the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). mRNA expression of alpha-SMA, collagen and collagen were measured by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1beta in serum were detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Alkali hydrolysis method was conducted to investigate the content of hydroxyproline (HYP). Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), Smad3 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) protein level were examined by Western blot assay. RESULTS: DBT significantly reduced the severity of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation as indicated by minimizing the lost of weight, and by lowering the levels of lung index, inflammation score, Ashcroft score, collagen volume fraction (%), HYP, alpha-SMA, collagen , collagen , TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, TGF-beta1, Smad3 and PAI-1, consistent with the effect of prednisone. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that DBT is able to ameliorate the pulmonary fibrosis, the possible mechanism may involve inhibition of pulmonary inflammation and collagen deposition, possibly via suppressing TGF-beta1/Smad3/PAI-1 signaling pathway.

21770858|t|Kamikihi-to (KKT) rescues axonal and synaptic degeneration associated with memory impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, 5XFAD.
21770858|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Current agents for AD are employed for symptomatic therapy and insufficient to cure. We consider that this is quite necessary for AD treatment and have investigated axon/synapse formation-promoting activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Kamikihi-to [KKT; traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine] on memory deficits in an AD model, 5XFAD. KKT (200 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered for 15 days to 5XFAD mice. Object recognition memory was tested in vehicle-treated wild-type and 5XFAD mice and KKT-treated 5XFAD mice. KKT-treated 5XFAD mice showed significant improvement of object recognition memory. KKT treatment significantly reduced the number of amyloid plaques in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Only inside of amyloid plaques were abnormal structures such as bulb-like axons and swollen presynaptic boutons observed. These degenerated axons and presynaptic terminals were significantly reduced by KKT treatment in the frontal cortex. In primary cortical neurons, KKT treatment significantly increased axon length when applied after Abeta(25-35)-induced axonal atrophy had progressed. In conclusion, KKT improved object recognition memory deficit in an AD model 5XFAD mice. Restoration of degenerated axons and synapses may be associated with the memory recovery by KKT.

35026620|t|Sheng Mai San ameliorated heat stress-induced liver injury via regulating energy metabolism and AMPK/Drp1-dependent autophagy process.
35026620|a|BACKGROUND: Liver damage is one of the most common complications in humans and animals after heat stress (HS). Sheng Mai San (SMS), a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that originated in the Jin Dynasty, exert a therapeutic effect on HS. However, how SMS prevents liver injury after heat exposure remains unknown. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effect and molecular mechanisms of SMS on HS-induced liver injury. STUDY DESIGN: A comprehensive strategy via incorporating pharmacodynamics, targeted metabolomics, and molecular biology technology was adopted to investigate energy metabolism changes and the therapeutic mechanisms of SMS in HS-induced rat liver injury. METHODS: First, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to HS (38 degrees C/ 75% RH/ 2 h/ day) for 7 consecutive days to establish the HS model, and SMS was given orally for treatment 2 h before heat exposure. Thereafter, liver function and pathological changes in liver tissue were evaluated. Finally, the underlying mechanisms of SMS were determined using targeted energy metabolomics to comprehensively analyze the metabolic pathways and were further verified through Western-blot and qRT-PCR assays. RESULTS: Our results showed that SMS alleviated HS-induced liver dysfunction by reducing the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and AST/ALT ratios in serum and improving hepatic pathological damage. Meanwhile, SMS suppressed inflammatory response, oxidative injury, and overexpression of heat shock proteins in liver tissue after heat exposure. With the help of targeted energy metabolomics, we found that SMS could effectively regulate glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to relieve energy metabolism disorder. Furthermore, we confirmed that SMS can facilitate the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis through a dynamin protein 1 (Drp1)-dependent mitophagy process. CONCLUSION: On the basis of energy metabolomics, the present study for the first time systematically illustrated the protective effect of SMS on HS-induced liver injury, and preliminarily confirmed that an AMPK-mediated Drp1-dependent mitophagy and mitochondria rebuilding process plays an important role in SMS intervention on HS-induced rat liver. Together, our study lends further support to the use of SMS in treating HS condition.

31757632|t|Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San alleviates functional dyspepsia in rats and modulates the composition of the gut microbiota.
31757632|a|The pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia (FD) is multifactorial, and the gut microbiota may play a significant role. Shen-Ling-Bai-Zhu-San (SLBZS), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been widely used in the treatment of FD, and appears to influence the gut microbiota. Therefore, we hypothesized that SLBZS would alleviate dyspeptic symptoms by adjusting the composition of the gut microbiota. To test this hypothesis, we aimed to evaluate the effects of SLBZS on FD and elucidate the mechanism that underlies the interactions between gut microbiota and FD during SLBZS treatment. We employed a rat model of FD induced by multiple forms of chronic mild stimulation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing were used to analyze the microbial communities in fecal samples from the rats. We found that the SLBZS improved dyspeptic symptoms in FD rats, such as weight loss, decreased intestinal motility, reduced absorptive capacity. Moreover, the SLBZS treatment reversed gut dysbiosis in FD. With SLBZS treatment, FD biomarkers including Prevotella, Mucispirillum and Akkermansia were decreased while SCFA-producing bacteria such as Adlercreutzia and Clostridium, and sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio were enriched. Additionally, SLBZS normalized the dysregulated function of the microbiome, upregulating the pathways of energy metabolism and decreasing the oxidative stress as well as bacterial pathogenesis. Our study demonstrated that SLBZS could ameliorate dyspepsia, and amend the dysregulated composition and function of the gut microbial community, providing insight into the mechanism of SLBZS treatment for FD from the perspective of gut microbiota.

34295151|t|Qing-Luo-Yin Alleviated Monocytes/Macrophages-Mediated Inflammation in Rats with Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis by Disrupting Their Interaction with (Pre)-Adipocytes Through PPAR-gamma Signaling.
34295151|a|BACKGROUND: The Chinese herbal formula Qing-Luo-Yin (QLY) has been successfully used in rheumatoid arthritis treatment for decades. It exhibits notable immune and metabolism regulatory properties. Thereby, we investigated its effects on the interplay between (pre)-adipocytes and monocytes/macrophages under adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) circumstances. METHODS: Fat reservoir and histological characteristics of white fat tissues (WAT) in AIA rats receiving QLY treatment were examined upon sacrifice. Metabolic parameters, clinical indicators, and oxidative stress levels were determined using corresponding kits, while mRNA/protein expression was investigated by PCR and immunoblotting methods. M1 macrophage distribution in WAT was assessed by flow cytometry. The effects of QLY on (pre)-adipocytes were further validated by experiments in vitro. RESULTS: Compared with normal healthy controls, body weight and circulating triglyceride were declined in AIA rats, but serological levels of free fatty acids and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were increased. mRNA IL-1beta and iNOS expression in white blood cells and rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, MCP-1 and IL-1beta production in serum/WAT were up-regulated. Obvious CD86(+)CD11b(+) macrophages were enriched in WAT. Meanwhile, expression of PPAR-gamma and SIRT1 and secretion of adiponectin and leptin in these AIA rats were impaired. QLY restored all these pathological changes. Of note, it significantly stimulated PPAR-gamma expression in the treated AIA rats. Accordingly, QLY-containing serum promoted SCD-1, PPAR-gamma, and SIRT1 expression in pre-adipocytes cultured in vitro. AIA rats-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells suppressed PPAR-gamma and SCD-1 expression in co-cultured pre-adipocytes, but serum from AIA rats receiving QLY treatment did not exhibit this potential. The changes on PPAR-gamma expression eventually resulted in varied adipocyte differentiation statuses. PPAR-gamma selective inhibitor T0070907 abrogated QLY-induced MCP-1 production decline in LPS-primed pre-adipocytes and reduced adiponectin secretion. CONCLUSION: QLY was potent in promoting PPAR-gamma expression and consequently disrupted inflammatory feedback in WAT by altering monocytes/macrophages polarization and adipocytes differentiation.

32351603|t|Potential Molecular Mechanisms of Zhibai Dihuang Wan in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Based on Network Biology.
32351603|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a refractory autoimmune disease. Zhibai Dihuang Wan (ZDW) has frequently been used for treating SLE in China and been proved to have a prominent role in decreasing SLE patients' morality rate. However, the active substances in ZDW and the molecular mechanisms of ZDW in SLE remain unclear. This study identified the bioactive compounds and delineated the molecular targets and potential pathways of ZDW by using a network biology approach. First, we collected putative targets of ZDW based on TCMSP, GeneCards, and STITCH databases and built a network containing the interactions between the putative targets of ZDW and known therapeutic targets of SLE. Then, the key hubs were imported to DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 to perform gene ontology biological process (GOBP) and pathway enrichment analysis. A total of 95 nodes including 73 putative targets of ZDW were determined as major hubs in terms of their node degree. The results of GOBP and pathway enrichment analysis indicated that putative targets of ZDW mostly were involved in various pathways associated with inflammatory response and apoptosis. More importantly, eleven putative targets of ZDW (CASP3, BCL2, BAX, CYCS, NFKB1, NFKBIA, IL-6, IL-1beta, PTGS2, CCL2, and TNF-alpha) were recognized as active factors involved in the main biological functions of treatment, implying the underlying mechanisms of ZDW acting on SLE. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of ZDW in SLE, from the molecular level to the pathway level.

7532482|t|[Clinical study on comparison of tonifying kidney replenishing vitality and removing blood stasis and resolving mass in the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia].
7532482|a|70 patients with prostatic hyperplasia were observed. Among them 34 cases were treated with the regime of tonifying Kidney-replenishing Vitality (TKRV) and the other 36 cases were treated with removing blood stasis and resolving mass (Xiao Jin Dan). The dysuria of the patients in both groups was improved after treatment. The results of the transrectal ultrasonotomography showed as follows: (1) The effect on the volume of residual urine: the average values of the TKRV group were 43.29 +/- 14.03 ml before treatment and 17.24 +/- 5.13 ml after treatment (P < 0.05), that of Xiao Jin Dan were 21.17 +/- 5.57 ml and 7.37 +/- 2.87 ml respectively (P < 0.01). (2) The effect on the size of the prostate gland: only 10 cases in the TKRV group were measured both before and after treatment, the average size of the prostate gland were 46.30 +/- 8.23 ml and 43.60 +/- 4.52 ml respectively (P < 0.05), and 4 cases were decreased in the size after treatment. 35 cases in Xiao Jin Dan group were measured before and after treatment and their size of prostate gland were 47.83 +/- 2.50 ml and 43.45 +/- 2.24 ml (P < 0.01) respectively. 27 out of the 35 cases were decreased in their size of prostate gland. The results showed that the therapeutic effect of Xiao Jin Dan was slightly better than that of the TKRV, which suggested that the prostatic hyperplasia was closely related to the syndrome of Kidney-Deficiency as well as to the syndrome of Blood Stasis. So it is important that we combined the reinforcement and elimination in the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia.

19211027|t|Dissection of the role of paeoniflorin in the traditional Chinese medicinal formula Si-Ni-San against contact dermatitis in mice.
19211027|a|AIMS: The roles of specific active ingredients in Chinese medicinal formulas have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we selectively deleted and replenished paeoniflorin from Si-Ni-San, a traditional Chinese prescription, and aimed to identify the molecular basis of how paeoniflorin exerted its effect in Si-Ni-San. MAIN METHODS: Contact dermatitis was induced in mice with picryl chloride. Paeoniflorin was selectively deleted from Si-Ni-San by an immunoaffinity column. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used in this study. KEY FINDINGS: Both Si-Ni-San and paeoniflorin significantly reduced ear swelling in mice while the paeoniflorin-deleted Si-Ni-San (Si-Ni-San(PF-)) showed little ameliorative effect. In lipopolysaccharide-evoked macrophages, Si-Ni-San and paeoniflorin markedly inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, cyclooxygenase-2 activity, as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation while Si-Ni-San(PF-) exhibited no or slight inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect on the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha reappeared when different proportions of paeoniflorin were replenished in Si-Ni-San(PF-). In addition, the expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in T cells, rather than macrophages, was significantly inhibited by Si-Ni-San, but not Si-Ni-San(PF-). Our data indicate paeoniflorin is the principal component of Si-Ni-San, exerting negative regulation on the function of macrophages in contact dermatitis. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study suggests that dissecting the role of specific constituents in medicinal formulas through selective deletion and replenishment may be a useful strategy in recognizing and validating an active ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine.

22019702|t|Metabolomic study of insomnia and intervention effects of Suanzaoren decoction using ultra-performance liquid-chromatography/electrospray-ionization synapt high-definition mass spectrometry.
22019702|a|Metabolomics is the comprehensive assessment of endogenous metabolites of a biological system in a holistic context, and its property consists with the global view of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Suanzaoren decoction (SZRD), an ancient TCM formulae, has been used for treating insomnia for centuries, and its mechanism remains unclear completely. This paper was designed to explore globally metabolomic characters of the insomnia and the therapeutic effects of SZRD. Ultra-performance liquid-chromatography/electrospray-ionization synapt high-definition mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-SYNAPT-HDMS) combined with pattern recognition approaches including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) were integrated to approximate the comprehensive metabolic signature and discover differentiating metabolites. The changes in metabolic profiling were restored to their baseline values after SZRD treatment according to the PCA score plots. Altogether, the current metabonomic approach based on UPLC/ESI-SYNAPT-HDMS indicate 20 ions (9 in the negative mode, 11 in the positive mode) as "differentiating metabolites". The alterations in these metabolites were associated with perturbations in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, in response to insomnia through immune and nervous system. Of note, we found that SZRD increases sleep activity and exhibits binding affinity for serotonin receptors. These results implicate the therapeutic effects of SZRD may mediate through serotonergic activation. Our findings also show the robust UPLC/ESI-SYNAPT-HDMS techniques is promising for metabolites profiling analysis of TCM and open new perspectives to using metabolomics platform to resolve special TCM issues.

30992708|t|Meta-Analysis of Xihuang Pill Efficacy When Combined with Chemotherapy for Treatment of Breast Cancer.
30992708|a|OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the efficacy of Xihuang pill (XHP) in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. METHODS: Three English and four Chinese databases were searched. Literature was screened using EndNote X7 and data were analyzed by Review Manager. RESULTS: This review included 13 randomized clinical studies of 1272 patients. The results showed that XHP increased the tumor response [risk ratio (RR) = 2.91; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.98-4.26] and improved Karnofsky performance score (KPS) for breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy [RR = 4.96; 95% CI = 2.07-11.86]. In addition, XHP treatment significantly reduced chemotherapy-induced adverse events, including nausea and vomiting [RR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.33-0.74], WBC reduction [RR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.47-1.06], platelet reduction [RR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.19-1.44], hemoglobin reduction [RR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.19-0.52], and hepatic function damage [RR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.35-1.11]. CONCLUSION: XHP combined with chemotherapy in comparison with chemotherapy alone could significantly enhance the tumor response, improve KPS, and alleviate toxicity induced by chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.

9764846|t|The herbal medicine Sho-saiko-to inhibits growth and metastasis of malignant melanoma primarily developed in ret-transgenic mice.
9764846|a|Sho-saiko-to is the most popular herbal medicine in Japan. We investigated the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of Sho-saiko-to and its chemically defined ingredients on the primary skin melanoma that developed in a metallothionein-I (MT)/ret transgenic mouse line and on a melanoma cell line (Mel-ret), which was derived from a primary tumor developed in a MT/ret transgenic mouse. In vitro, Sho-saiko-to suppressed the growth of Mel-ret cells more strongly than any single ingredient of Sho-saiko-to, although baicalin as one of several ingredients tested also suppressed it significantly. In vivo, Sho-saiko-to (i) significantly (p < 0.02) prolonged the onset of tumor development (1.5 mo), (ii) definitely retarded the transition to malignancy, (iii) significantly decreased the incidence of distant metastasis to brain (p < 0.002), kidney (p < 0.05), and liver (p < 0.05) at the malignant stage, and (iv) significantly (p < 0.02) prolonged life span (2.6 mo). Moreover, Sho-saiko-to and baicalin down-regulated the matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 expression levels, and upregulated their inhibitor expression level in both the primary tumors and Mel-ret cells. In conclusion, Sho-saiko-to displayed anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects on melanoma with regulation of the balance of matrix metalloproteinase and tissue inhibitor of the matrix metalloproteinase levels.

15863137|t|Inhibitory effects of herbal drugs on the growth of human ovarian cancer cell lines through the induction of apoptosis.
15863137|a|OBJECTIVE: In order to develop and search for more effective and safe treatments for early and advanced stages of ovarian cancer, we examined the direct effects of four extracts of Chinese herbal drugs on ovarian cancer cells in vitro. METHODS: The growth inhibition of four herbal drugs on a total of six cell lines of human ovarian cancer cells was determined by a Cell Counting Kit-8 by counting viable cells. Apoptotic cells induced by herbal drugs were detected by using MEBCYTO Apoptosis Kit. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The significance of the difference was analyzed with a two-sided Student's t test. A P value less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. RESULTS: The MN, A2780, and KF cell lines exhibited significant growth inhibition in the presence of Sho-saiko-to concentrations of 150 microg/ml, 300 microg/ml, and 500 microg/ml, respectively, and at the concentration of 1000 microg/ml, Sho-saiko-to demonstrated a significant apoptotic induction effect on all six kinds of ovarian cancer cell lines. This concentration is the same as the blood concentration attained when 7.5 g of Sho-saiko-to per day is orally administered and all absorbed. CONCLUSIONS: Sho-saiko-to exhibited significant growth inhibition of ovarian cancer cell lines, and the mechanisms of the inhibitory effects can be attributed, in part, to apoptosis induced by Sho-saiko-to.

31277537|t|[Comparison of the clinical effects between Dihuang Decoction and alendronate sodium in the treatment of primary osteoporosis].
31277537|a|OBJECTIVE: To study and compare the clinical effects of Rehmannia Decoction and alendronate sodium for the treatment of primary osteoporosis. METHODS: From January 2016 to December 2017, 72 patients with primary osteoporosis who took Dihuang Decoction(DHD) orally and alendronate regularly for more than one year were randomly divided into 2 groups:experimental group and control group. The experimental group consisted of 14 males and 22 females, with an average age of(63.97+/-3.70) years old. The patients in the experimental group took Chinese medicine DHD, one dose each time, one time in the morning and one time in the evening, twice a week. The control group consisted of 16 males and 20 females with an average age of(63.36+/-3.07) years old. Patients in the control group were given alendronate 70 mg orally once a week. The basic treatment for osteoporosis remained unchanged in both groups(600 mg of calcium carbonate D3 and 0.5 mug of calcitriol capsules were taken daily). Bone mineral density (BMD) of femoral neck and lumbar vertebrae was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after treatment for one year. The levels of serum collagen type I C-terminal peptide (beta-CTX) and serum osteoclast (SOST) were measured before and after treatment for two groups. RESULTS: The age, bone mineral density, SOST and beta-CTX baseline values between the two groups before and after anti-osteoporosis treatment were compared. The difference was not statistically significant(P>0.05). Compared with the two groups, the BMD of femoral neck and lumbar vertebrae were increased after 1 year of anti-osteoporosis treatment. The differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). The value of serum beta-CTX was significantly lower than before. The t values were 52.002 and 50.071 respectively. The value of serum SOST was increased than that before treatment. The t values were -29.242 and -30.807 respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine was compared between the two groups after treatment. The P values were 0.294 and 0.478 respectively. The difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The serum beta-CTX values were compared between the two groups after treatment. The P value was 0.908. The serum SOST values were compared between the two groups after treatment. The P value was 0.888. The difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, traditional Chinese medicine DHD is used to treat osteoporosis. It is found that DHD and alendronate have a good effect. The DHD can be used as a choice of Chinese medicine in the treatment of primary osteoporosis.

24373196|t|Xiaochaihu Decoction attenuates the vicious circle between the oxidative stress and the ALP inactivation through LPS-catecholamines interactions in gut, liver and brain during CCI4+ethanol-induced mouse HCC.
24373196|a|BACKGROUND: Xiaochaihu Decoction (XCHD) prevents hepatocarcinogenesis in association with inhibition of oxidative stress. However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-catecholamines (CA) interactions in gut, liver and brain may play an important role in the status of oxidative stress. This study was to assess whether XCHD attenuates the vicious circle between oxidative stress and ALP inactivation through LPS-CA interactions. METHODS: Hepatocellular carcinoma group (HCC) were induced by CCI4 + ethanol; HCC with Liver Depression and Spleen Deficiency (HCC + LDSD) were induced by squeezing tails (30 min/day), solitary breeding and intermittent fasting on the basis of HCC; XCHD was administered after 4 weeks of the HCC + LDSD. The degree of tissue injury were studied using a scoring system, and brain weights were measured. Peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid (VMA, CA metabolites), lipopolysaccharide-phosphate (LPS-P), ALP activity (ALP-A) and Concanavalin A (ConA)-binding rate of ALP (ALP-C) were determined by colorimetric method and lectin (ConA) affinity precipitation method. RESULTS: More injuries and ONOO(-), MDA, VMA, LPS-P, ALP-C were increased, ALP-A were decreased in the gut, liver and brain of HCC group, the most in HCC + LDSD group, after treatment with XCHD, all of which were improved. A positive association found between gut-liver-brain injury and ONOO(-), MDA, VMA, LPS-P, ALP-C, between ONOO(-), MDA, VMA, LPS-P and ALP-C in the gut, liver and brain, and a negative association found between gut-liver-brain injury and ALP-A, between ALP-A and ONOO(-), MDA, VMA, LPS-P, ALP-C in the gut, liver and brain. CONCLUSIONS: XCHD can attenuates the vicious circle between the oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, N-glycan deficiency and inactivation of ALP through LPS-CA interactions in gut, liver and brain.

8022119|t|Protective effects of kamikihi-to, a traditional Chinese medicine, against cerebral ischemia, hypoxia and anoxia in mice and gerbils.
8022119|a|The protective effects of Kamikihi-To (KMK), a traditional Chinese medicine, against cerebral ischemia, hypoxia and anoxia were investigated with various experimental models in mice and gerbils. KMK (2.0 g/kg/day, p.o. for 5 days) significantly prolonged the survival time of mice subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. KMK (0.5 and 2.0 g/kg/day, p.o. for 5 days) also prolonged the survival time of mice injected with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA: 80 mg/kg, i.v.). Furthermore, KMK (in a diet containing 8% KMK given orally for 34 days) showed protective effects against delayed neuronal death in CA1 pyramidal cells in the gerbil hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia. On the other hand, we failed to show any protective effects of KMK (0.5-2.0 g/kg/day, p.o. for 5 days) against normobaric hypoxia and KCN-induced cytotoxic anoxia in mice. These results suggest that KMK may have protective effects against cerebral ischemic disorders, but not against severe hypoxic and anoxic disorders.

9703264|t|Expression of the anti-metastatic effect induced by Juzen-taiho-to is based on the content of Shimotsu-to constituents.
9703264|a|We investigated the inhibitory effect of oral administration of Juzen-taiho-to, a Kampo Japanese herbal medicine, and its related formulations on the experimental liver and lung metastasis of tumor cells in vivo. Oral administration of Juzen-taiho-to for 7 d before tumor inoculation significantly reduced the number of liver metastatic colonies of colon 26-L5 carcinoma cells and attenuated the increase of liver weight in a dose-dependent manner ranging from 4 to 40 mg/d. Its oral administration for this same period before tumor inoculation also significantly inhibited lung metastasis of B16-BL6 melanoma cells. Juzen-taiho-to originally consisted of 8 crude drugs derived from Shimotsu-to and Shikunshi-to prescriptions together with two crude drugs (Cinnamomi Cortex and Astragali Radix). Oral administration of Shimotsu-to as well as Juzen-taiho-to for 7 d before tumor inoculation resulted in a significant reduction in the number of metastatic colonies and the liver weight as compared with the control, whereas Shikunshi-to did not exhibit such an inhibitory effect. Unsei-in containing four Shimotsu-to constituents was also active in inhibiting liver metastasis. Toki-shakuyaku-san and Ninjin-yoei-to, which include all Shimotsu-to constituents except Rehmanniae Radix and Cnidii Rhizoma, respectively, did not show a significant anti-metastatic effect. Rikkunshi-to and Ninjin-yoei-to, which contain Shikunshi-to constituents, did not affect the inhibition of liver metastasis. Hochu-ekki-to treatment before tumor inoculation also led to a significant inhibition of liver metastasis, probably through an inhibitory mechanism different from Juzen-taiho-to. These results suggest that the anti-metastatic effect of Juzen-taiho-to is partly associated with its Shimotsu-to-derived constituents.

23668015|t|[Experimental study on therapeutic effect of Dabuyin Wan on TRUE precocious puberty in female rats].
23668015|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the therapeutic effect of Dabuyin Wan on TRUE precocious puberty of female rats and its possible mechanism. METHOD: Twenty-two-day-old female SD rats were subcutaneously injected with 40 mg x kg(-1) N-methyl-DL-aspartic acid (NMA) at 14:00 and 16:00 every day; meanwhile, the rats were given Dabuyin Wan for intervention. Visual inspection was conducted for the time of vaginal opening. The first estrus was observed by yaginal smear test. Their ovaries and uterus were weighed to calculate organ coefficients. Conventional pathological slices were made to observe morphological changes in ovaries and uterus and calculate the thickness of uterine walls and the number of corpus luteums. The level of E2 in serum was detected to assess the therapeutic effect of Dabuyin Wan on NMA precocious puberty in rats. expressions of GnRH, GPR54 and Kiss-1 mRNA in hypothalamus were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR to investigate the possible mechanism of Dabuyin Wan. RESULT: Dabuyin Wan at 3.24 g x kg(-1) and 1.62 g x kg(-1) significantly decreased the organ coefficients in rats with precocious puberty (P < 0.05), decrease the number of vaginal openings in rats (P < 0.01) and the thickness of uterine walls and the number of corpus luteums (P < 0.05), and notably down-regulated expressions of GnRH, GPR54 and Kiss-1 mRNA in hypothalamus (P < 0.05), without significant impact on E2 in serum. CONCLUSION: Dabuyin Wan may inhibit GnRH synthesis and release as well as startup of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by down-regulating Kiss-1/GPR54 mRNA expression in hypothalamus, in order to realize the therapeutic effect on TRUE precocious puberty.

32377518|t|Banxia Xiexin Decoction Ameliorates t-BHP-Induced Apoptosis in Pancreatic Beta Cells by Activating the PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 Signaling Pathway.
32377518|a|BACKGROUND: Banxia Xiexin Decoction (BXXD) reportedly regulates glycolipid metabolism and inhibits pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis. This study is aimed at investigating the protective effect of BXXD on tert-butyl hydroperoxide- (t-BHP-) induced apoptosis in MIN6 cells and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: MIN6 cells were preincubated with BXXD or liraglutide (Li) with or without PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY) for 12 h, following which t-BHP was added to induce MIN6 cell apoptosis. The protective effects of BXXD on MIN6 cells were evaluated by detecting cell viability and proliferation and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The antiapoptotic effects were evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay (TUNEL). Malondialdehyde and glutathione peroxidase content and superoxide dismutase activity were measured using commercial kits. The expression of PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway-related signal molecules, and that of apoptotic indicators Bax, P27, and Caspase-3, was quantified using western blotting. RESULTS: Preincubation with BXXD significantly improved t-BHP-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis and enhanced GSIS. t-BHP induced the generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibited the activities of antioxidant enzymes, which could be neutralized by pretreatment with BXXD. BXXD promoted the phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO1 in t-BHP-induced MIN6 cells. Moreover, BXXD attenuated the expression of related apoptotic indicators Bax, P27, and Caspase-3. LY abolished these effects of BXXD. CONCLUSION: BXXD protected MIN6 cells against t-BHP-induced apoptosis and improved insulin secretory function through modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and the downstream FOXO1, thus suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

11903745|t|A Japanese herbal medicine, Sho-saiko-to, prevents gut ischemia/reperfusion-induced hepatic microvascular dysfunction in rats.
11903745|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: We have reported that gut ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) causes hepatic microvascular dysfunction. Nitric oxide (NO) has been found to be a modulator of the adhesive interactions between leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells. Sho-saiko-to (TJ-9), a Japanese herbal medicine, is reported to have protective effects against liver injury and to regulate NO production. The objective of this study was to determine whether TJ-9 affects hepatic microvascular dysfunction elicited by gut I/R, and to investigate the role of NO. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were exposed to 30 min of gut ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Intravital microscopy was used to monitor leukocyte recruitment and the number of non-perfused sinusoids (NPS). Plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities were measured. In another set of experiments, TJ-9 (1 g/kg per day intragastrically) was administered to rats for 7 days. In some experiments, dexamethasone (ST) (2 mg/kg per day intravenously) was administered. RESULTS: In control rats, gut I/R elicited increases in the number of stationary leukocytes, NPS, and plasma TNF-alpha and ALT activities, and these changes were mitigated by the pretreatment with TJ-9. Pretreatment with an NO synthase inhibitor diminished the protective effects of TJ-9 on the increase in leukostasis in the pericentral region, NPS, and plasma TNF-alpha levels, but not its effect on the increase in leukostasis in the midzonal region, total number of stationary leukocytes, or plasma ALT activities. Pretreatment with TJ-9 increased plasma nitrite/nitrate levels. The responses caused by gut I/R were attenuated by the pretreatment with ST. Pretreatment with an NO synthase inhibitor did not affect the effect of ST. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TJ-9 attenuates the gut I/R-induced hepatic microvascular dysfunction and inflammatory responses such as TNF-alpha production in the early phase via enhancement of NO production, and sequential hepatocellular damage via its anti-inflammatory effect like corticosteroid effect.

30950126|t|Tao-Hong-Si-Wu decoction reduces ischemia reperfusion rat myoblast cells calcium overloading and inflammation through the Wnt/IP3R/CAMKII pathway.
30950126|a|Limb ischemia reperfusion (LIRI) injury is associated with serious local and systemic effects. Reperfusion may augment tissue injury in excess of that produced by ischemia alone. Calcium overloading and inflammation are considered to be two of the pathological mechanisms of limb ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Tao-Hong-Si-Wu decoction (THSWD) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine with a powerful anti-inflammatory properties. We studied the probable restorative effect of THSWD on limb I/R-induced calcium overloading and inflammation in myoblast obtained from gastrocnemius muscle tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats (Frizzled Z5,a wnt5a blocker; KN-93, a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamkII) blocker; XeC, a IP3R blocker as positive controls). The simulated ischemia and reperfusion(I/R) solutions were used to imitate LIRI environment. The results showed that after I/R treatment, the secretion of proinflammatory factors (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) and Wnt5a/Ca(2+) signal molecules (wnt5a, camkII, and IP3R) upregulated significantly, the Ca(2+) concentration enhanced too in myoblast cells. THSWD pretreatment decreased the secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, Ca(2+) concentration; and abated the Wnt5a/Ca(2+) signal molecules of wnt5a, camkII and IP3R expression activated by I/R injury; but could not abated the Wnt11 and protein kinase C (PKC) expression significantly, the results was similar with Frizzled Z5 treatment cells. Our research illustrated that THSWD may have a mitigating effect on LIRI targeting Wnt/IP3R/CAMKII but not Wnt/IP3R/PKC signaling pathway for the first time. This study may encourage the use of THSWD in the critical clinical settings with LIRI.

30953821|t|Zuogui Pills inhibit mitochondria-dependent apoptosis of follicles in a rat model of premature ovarian failure.
30953821|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zuogui Pills (ZGP), which is a classical prescription of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been reported to be widely used in the treatment of premature ovarian failure (POF). AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the therapeutic effects of ZGP on the treatment of POF induced by chemotherapy, and elucidate the potential molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (N=54) were randomized to six groups, containing the Control group, Model group, three ZGP groups and Triptorelin group which was served as a positive control. The Triptorelin group received triptorelin injection ten days before model establishment by cyclophosphamide. The three ZGP groups (high dose group, medium dose group and low dose group) were given a daily intragastric administration of ZGP at doses of 3.2, 1.6 and 0.8g/kg for sixty days. We observed the general growth of rats and examed the estrous cycle and the rate of pregnancy, ovarian ultrastructures, follicles and corpora lutea numbers. The serum hormone concentrations were measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To explore the molecular mechanism of the effect, gene and protein expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and Cyt-c related to apoptosis were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), Western Blot and Immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively. RESULTS: After treating with ZGP, though the rate of pregnancy showed no significant difference, the estrous cycle, ovarian ultrastructures, numbers of follicles and corpora lutea were improved significantly. And ZGP led to a significant lower concentration of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the serum, and the concentration of oestradiol (E2) was increased. Furthermore, a significant downregulation of Bax, cytochrome c (Cyt-c), and upregulation of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) both on gene and protein levels were observed after the administration with ZGP. And effects showed a positive correlation with the dosages. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that ZGP exerted significant effect on POF, which was meditated by inhibiting mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in the follicles.

34354757|t|Network Pharmacology-Based Analysis of Gegenqinlian Decoction Regulating Intestinal Microbial Activity for the Treatment of Diarrhea.
34354757|a|Gegenqinlian decoction (GD) has been extensively used for the treatment of diarrhea with intestinal dampness-heat syndrome (IDHS) with a satisfying therapeutic effect. The purpose of this study is to clarify the active ingredients and mechanism of GD in the treatment of diarrhea with IDHS. The TCMSP database was used to screen out the active ingredients of the four Chinese herbal medicines in GD, and the targets of the active ingredients were predicted. We selected the targets related to diarrhea through the DisGeNET database, then used the NCBI database to screen out related targets of lactase and sucrase, and constructed the visual network to search for the active ingredients of GD in the treatment of diarrhea and related mechanisms of the targets. Combined with network pharmacology, we screened out 146 active ingredients in GD corresponding to 252 ingredient targets, combined with 328 disease targets in diarrhea, and obtained 12 lactase targets and 11 sucrase targets. The key active ingredients involved quercetin, formononetin, beta-sitosterol kaempferol, and wogonin. Furthermore, molecular docking showed that these five potential active ingredients had good affinities with the core targets PTGS2. The active ingredients in GD (such as quercetin, formononetin, and beta-sitosterol) may increase the microbial activity of the intestinal mucosa of mice and reduce the microbial activity of the intestinal contents through multiple targets, thereby achieving the effect of treating diarrhea.

31191319|t|Neuroprotective Effects and Hepatorenal Toxicity of Angong Niuhuang Wan Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Brain Injury in Rats.
31191319|a|Angong Niuhuang Wan (AGNHW) is a classic prescription in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used for stroke treatment, but its efficacies remain to be confirmed. With its arsenic- and mercury-containing materials, the application of AGNHW raises great safety concerns. Herein, we aim to explore the neuropharmacological effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and evaluate the toxicological effects of AGNHW for better use. Male SD rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and following 22 h of reperfusion. AGNHW (257 mg/kg, 1x AGNHW) were orally administered for pharmacological effects and 257, 514, and 1,028 mg/kg (equivalent to 1x, 2x, 4x AGNHW) were used for the toxicological study. The results revealed that AGNHW treatment reduced the infarct size and protected the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in the MCAO rat ischemic stroke model. AGNHW treatment up-regulated bcl-2 expression and down-regulated the expressions of Bax, p47phox, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and inhibited the expressions and activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and reserved tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5 in the ischemic brains. These results indicated that the neuroprotective mechanisms of AGNHW could be associated with its antioxidant properties by inhibiting oxidative/nitrative stress-mediated MMP activation and protecting tight junction proteins in the ischemic brains. Administration of 1x AGNHW for 7 days would not induce the accumulation of mercury in blood, liver, and kidney at day 14. Administration of 2x AGNHW and 4x AGNHW for 7 days increased the level of mercury in the kidney. For arsenic level, administration of 1x AGNHW for 7 days would increase the level of arsenic in the liver and blood without increase of arsenic in the kidney at day 14. Administration of 2x AGNHW and 4x AGNHW for 7 days would further increase the level of arsenic in the liver and blood. There is no influence on body weight, organ index, histological structures, and renal and liver functions. These results suggest that short-term treatment of AGNHW within 1 week should be safe and has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

15307704|t|[Effect of xiaochaihu decoction and different herbal formulations of its components on cytokines of carrageenan induced pleuritis in rats].
15307704|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the anti-inflammatory effect and possible mechanism of Xiaochaihu Decoction (XCHD) and the different herbal formulations of its components. METHODS: Rat model of pleuritis was established by thoracic injecting 0.2 ml of 1% carrageenan. Rats in the treated groups were medicated with XCHD (11 g/kg) and the different herbal formulations of its components respectively as follows: thorowax root-scutellaria root (A, 3.5 g/kg), fresh ginger-pinellia tuber (B, 3 g/kg), ginseng-licorice root-jujube (C, 4.5 g/kg), A + B (6.5 g/kg), A + C (8 g/kg) and B + C (7.5 g/kg), and those in the normal group and the model group were given equal volume of instilled water, by way of gastrogavage for successive 5 days. Modeling was performed 2 hrs after the last medication. The amount of pleurorrhea, and leucocyte (WBC), marrow peroxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in pleurorrhea, and serum level of interleukin-8 (IL-8) were measured 12 hrs after modeling. RESULTS: As compared with the model group, all the parameters measured were lower in all the treated group (P < 0.05) , and IL-1beta content in pleurorrhea in the XCHD group and Group A, B and C were significantly lower (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: XCHD and the different herbal formulations have obvious anti-inflammatory effect, showing certain preventive and therapeutic effect on pleuritis. Among the different formulations, the XCHD, A, B and C had better effects. The effects might be related to inhibiting the increase of cytokines as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 to suppress the activation, infiltration and wandering of leucocytes.

20862970|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Fuzheng Huayu recipe and Huangqi tang on DMN-induced experimental liver cirrhosis in rats and explore the therapeutic characteristics of Buxu herbals on liver cirrhosis. METHOD: Liver cirrhosis in rats was induced by intraperitoneally injection of DMN for 4 weeks. Cirrhotic rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: model group, and Fuzheng Huayu recipe group, Huangqi tang group, Fuzheng Huayu recipe combined with Huangqi Tang group. The rats in treatment groups were orally administered with Fuzheng Huayu recipe, Huangqi tang, Fuzheng Huayu recipe combined with Huangqi tang (1:1), respectively. Normal and model control rats were given the equivalent normal saline. The body weight, liver weight and spleen weight were observed when rats were sacrificed. Liver histology was examined by HE staining and Sirius red staining. The liver function parameters including ALT, T. Bil and Alb were determined. The SOD activity and MDA content in liver tissues were also measured. Hepatic hydroxyproline (Hyp) content was determined by Jamall's method. The expression of alpha-SMA was determined by both immunohistochemistry staining and western blot method. RESULT: Compared with normal rats, the serum ALT and T. Bil levels in model rats increased obviously, by contrast, the serum Alb level decreased. There was a significant decline of SOD activity in model rat liver tissue, while the content of MDA and Hyp increased remarkably. A severe deterioration of liver architecture, infiltration of inflammatory cells and deposition of collagen were observed in model rat liver tissue. The expression of alpha-SMA also increased significantly. Compared with model rats, the liver function, lipid peroxidation parameters, Hyp content and liver histology were all improved in the 3 treatment groups. The combined group is better than any single-use group in decreasing collagen deposition and expression of alpha-SMA. CONCLUSION: Fuzheng Huayu recipe, Huangqi tang, Fuzheng Huayu recipe combined with Huangqi tang can attenuate liver fibrosis in DMN induced rats. Fuzheng Huayu recipe combined with Huangqi tang is better than that using alone in decreasing collagen deposition. The mechanism is partially due to the better effect of Fuzheng Huayu recipe combined with Huangqi tang on inhibiting activated HSC.
20862970|k|CONCLUSION: Fuzheng Huayu recipe, Huangqi tang, Fuzheng Huayu recipe combined with Huangqi tang can attenuate liver fibrosis in DMN induced rats.

32600331|t|Analysis of the pharmacological mechanism of Banxia Xiexin decoction in treating depression and ulcerative colitis based on a biological network module.
32600331|a|BACKGROUND: The network pharmacology method was used to predict the active components of Banxia Xiexin decoction, its targets and the key signalling pathways that are activated in the treatment of depression and ulcerative colitis to explore the common mechanism. METHODS: The active components and targets of Banxia Xiexin decoction were obtained by searching the ETCM,TCMSP and TCMIP database. The disease targets of depression and ulcerative colitis were obtained by combining the following the DisGeNET, OMIM,Drugbank,CTD and PharmGKB disease databases. The drug and disease target genes were obtained from the intersection of the herbal medicine targets and the disease targets and were imported into the STRING platform for the analysis of PPI network. The network modules were constructed using Cytoscape software. An analysis of the functional annotations of GO terms and KEGG signalling pathways was performed for each network module. Then, the tissue distribution, sub-cellular distribution and protein attributes of the key targets in the pathway were analysed by the BioGPS, Genecards and DisGeNET databases. RESULTS: The mechanism of Banxia Xiexin Decoction in the treatment of depression and ulcerative colitis is related to drug reaction, steroid metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, oxidative stress response, cell response to lipopolysaccharide, insulin secretion regulation, estradiol response and other biological functions, mainly through the regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine synaptic, arachidonic acid metabolism, HIF-1 signaling pathway and NF-kappa B signaling pathway can achieve the effect of same treatment for different diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of Banxia Xiexin Decoction in treating different diseases involves direct or indirect correlation of multiple signal pathways, mainly involved in drug metabolism and lipid metabolism, but also through comprehensive intervention of the body's nervous system, immune system, digestive system and other systems. The effective components of Banxia Xiexin Decoction are mainly act on eight key target proteins (such as ALB, IL6, VEGFA, TNF, PTGS2, MAPK1, STAT3, EGFR) to carry out multi-target effect mechanism, biological mechanism of treating different diseases with the same treatment, and related mechanism of overall treatment, which provide theoretical reference for further research on the material basis and mechanism of Banxiaxiexin decoction on antidepressant and prevention and treatment of ulcerative colitis.

31001354|t|Simiao Pill Attenuates Collagen-Induced Arthritis in Rats through Suppressing the ATX-LPA and MAPK Signalling Pathways.
31001354|a|OBJECTIVE: Simiao pill (SM), a traditional Chinese formula, has been used as an antirheumatic drug in clinical practice for hundreds of years. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic synovial inflammation and hyperplasia, cartilage destruction, and joint damage. This study was designed to investigate the protective effects of SM on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. It also aimed to explore whether this protective effect of SM was related to the inhibition of the ATX-LPA and MAPK signalling pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were injected with a collagen II emulsion at the end of the tail and on the back to induce arthritis. Treatment with different doses of SM was conducted by intragastric administration. Then, body weights and arthritis scores were measured. The serum levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, C-reactive protein (CRP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), autotaxin (ATX), and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) were determined by ELISA. Pathological changes in the joints were measured by micro-CT and assessed via haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The expression of ATX, LPA receptor 1 (LPA1) was detected by immunohistochemical staining, and the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: SM significantly alleviated arthritis symptoms, inhibited bone erosion, and decreased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, CRP, ATX, and LPA in the sera of CIA rats. Importantly, SM clearly reduced the protein expression of LPA1 and ATX. The activation of the MAPK signalling pathway was also inhibited by SM in the synovial tissues of CIA rats. CONCLUSIONS: The antirheumatic effects of SM were associated with the regulation of the ATX-LPA and MAPK pathways, the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production, and the alleviation of cartilage and bone injury. These findings suggest that SM might be a promising alternative candidate for RA therapy.
31001354|k|CONCLUSIONS: The antirheumatic effects of SM were associated with the regulation of the ATX-LPA and MAPK pathways, the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production, and the alleviation of cartilage and bone injury.

15339534|t|[Effect of Wuling Powder on rats with renal hypertension].
15339534|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of Wuling Powder extract on rats with renal hypertension and to evaluate the influence of it on the volume of urine and the concentrations of Na(+), K(+), Cl(-). METHODS: Reformed Gold-blatt hypertension rat model (G-2K1C) was established. The rats were divided into 6 groups as follows: sham-operation group; model group, Wuling Powder high dosage group (80 g/kg), Wuling Powder middle dosage group (40 g/kg), Wuling Powder low dosage group (20 g/kg), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) group (25 mg/kg). Urine volume of the rats was measured during the experiment. Tail arterial pressure and [Na(+)], [K(+)], [Cl(-)] in serum of the rats were detected after 30 days of treatment. RESULTS: The blood pressure of the G-2K1C rats was decreased in the three Wuling Powder groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01), but higher than that of the false-operation group (P<0.01), and there was no difference between each of the Wuling Powder groups and the HCT group (P>0.05). Diuretic effect of the three dosages of Wuling Powder was weaker than that of the HCT (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The effects of the three dosages of Wuling Powder and HCT on [Na(+)] and [Cl(-)] in the serum were not obviously different (P>0.05), but [K(+)] of the HCT group was significantly decreased compared with that of the false-operation group and the three Wuling Powder groups (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Wuling Powder extract had satisfying therapeutic effects in increasing the discharge of urine, decreasing the blood pressure and keeping the balance of the serum electrolyte contents in rats with renal hypertension.

34354371|t|Prevalence and Risk Factor Analysis of Constipation After Thoracolumbar Vertebral Compression Fractures.
34354371|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence and risk factors of constipation after thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures (TVCFs). METHODS: This retrospective study reviews the records of patients hospitalized between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018 with TVCFs. A total of 117 patient's records are included (n = 117). Univariate and multivariate analysis using the logistic regression method are carried out to identify the prevalence and potential risk factors for constipation after TVCF, including gender, age, number of fractured vertebrae, major segment of vertebral fracture, degree of compression, use of painkillers, diabetes, and the intervention of Zengyechengqi decoction. RESULTS: Among the 117 patients with TVCFs that were included in this study, 83 (70.9%) patients developed constipation. Univariate analysis showed that the factors of degree of vertebral compression and the preintervention of Zengyechengqi decoction had statistically significant effects on the incidence of constipation after TVCF (P < 0.05), indicating that they might contribute to the incidence of constipation after TVCF. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that degree of vertebral compression was a risk factor (P < 0.05), while preintervention of Zengyechengqi decoction was a protective factor (P < 0.05), for constipation after TVCF. CONCLUSION: Patients with vertebral fractures featuring a higher degree of compression may have a higher risk of constipation. Preintervention of Zengyechengqi decoction can reduce the incidence of constipation after TVCF.

29713130|t|Mucosa repair mechanisms of Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang mediated by CRH-R2 in murine, dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis.
29713130|a|AIM: To explore the significance of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-receptor (R)2 in mucosal healing of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and the effect of Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang (TXYF) on CRH-R2 expression and regulation. METHODS: Ulcerative colitis was induced in mice by administration of 3% (w/v) DSS for 7 d. Once the model was established, mice were administered urocortin-2 (30 mug/kg), a peptide which binds exclusively to CRH-R2, or various doses of aqueous TXYF extracts (2.8-11.2 g/kg), a CRH-R2 antagonist Astressin (Ast)2B (20 mug/kg), Ast2B + Ucn2, or Ast2B with various doses of aqueous TXYF extracts for 9 d. Colonic mucosal permeability was then evaluated by measuring the fluorescence intensity in serum. The colitis disease activity index (DAI), histology, body weight loss and colon length were assessed to evaluate the condition of colitis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling was used to detect apoptosis of the intestinal epithelial cells. The expression level of Ki-67 represented the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells and was detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of inflammation cytokines IL-6, TNF-alpha and CXCL-1 were examined in colon tissues using real-time PCR and ELISA kits. RESULTS: Compared with the DSS group, mice treated with the CRH-R2 antagonist Ast2B showed greater loss of body weight, shorter colon lengths (4.90 +/- 0.32 vs 6.21 +/- 0.34 cm, P < 0.05), and higher DAI (3.61 +/- 0.53 vs 2.42 +/- 0.32, P < 0.05) and histological scores (11.50 +/- 1.05 vs 8.33 +/- 1.03, P < 0.05). Additionally, the Ast2B group showed increased intestinal permeability (2.76 +/- 0.11 mug/mL vs 1.47 +/- 0.11 mug/mL, P < 0.001), improved secretion of inflammatory cytokines in colon tissue, and reduced colonic epithelial cell proliferation (4.97 +/- 4.25 vs 22.51 +/- 8.22, P < 0.05). Increased apoptosis (1422.39 +/- 90.71 vs 983.01 +/- 98.17, P < 0.001) was also demonstrated. The Ucn2 group demonstrated lower DAI (0.87 +/- 0.55 vs 2.42 +/- 0.32, P < 0.001) and histological scores (4.33 +/- 1.50 vs 8.33 +/- 1.03, P < 0.05). Diminished weight loss, longer colon length (9.58 +/- 0.62 vs 6.21 +/- 0.34 cm, P < 0.001), reduced intestinal permeability (0.75 +/- 0.07 vs 1.47 +/- 0.11 mug/mL, P < 0.001), inhibited secretion of inflammatory cytokines in colon tissue and increased colonic epithelial cell proliferation (90.04 +/- 15.50 vs 22.51 +/- 8.22, P < 0.01) were all observed. Reduced apoptosis (149.55 +/- 21.68 vs 983.01 +/- 98.17, P < 0.05) was also observed. However, significant statistical differences in the results of the Ast2B group and Ast2B + Ucn2 group were observed. TXYF was also found to ameliorate symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in mice and to promote mucosal repair like Ucn2. There were significant differences between the Ast2B + TXYF groups and the TXYF groups. CONCLUSION: CRH-R2 activates the intestinal mucosal antiinflammatory response by regulating migration, proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in colitis-induced mice, and plays an important antiinflammatory role. TXYF promotes mucosal repair in colitis mice by regulating CRH-R2.

28400733|t|Optimization of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction for Ischemic Stroke Treatment and Mechanistic Study by Metabolomic Profiling and Network Analysis.
28400733|a|Optimal drug proportions and mechanism deciphering of multicomponent drugs are critical for developing novel therapies to cope with complex diseases, such as stroke. In the present study, orthogonal experimental design was applied to explore the optimal proportion of the four component herbs in Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) on the treatment of ischemic stroke. The treatment efficacies and mechanisms were assessed using global and amino acids (AAs) targeted metabolomics, as well as correlation network analysis. The global NMR metabolomics results revealed that AAs metabolism was significantly perturbed in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats. The levels of 23 endogenous AAs were then subjected to HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis. These results complemented with neurobehavioral evaluations, cerebral infarct assessments, biochemical evaluations, histological inspections and immunohistochemistry observations strongly demonstrated that HLJDD with optimal proportion of 6 (Rhizoma coptidis): 4 (Radix scutellariae): 1 (Cortex phellodendr): 3 (Fructus Gardeniae) had the best efficacy on ischemic stroke, which could be ascribed to its modulation on AA metabolism. This integrated metabolomics approach showed the potential and applicable in deciphering the complex mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine formulae on the treatment of complicated diseases, which provided new means to assess the treatment effects of herb combinations and to further development of drugs or therapies based on these formulae.

32714880|t|Comparison of the Gut Microbiota Between Pulsatilla Decoction and Levofloxacin Hydrochloride Therapy on Escherichia coli Infection.
32714880|a|Gut microbiota serves as a critical indicator for gut health during treatment of pathogenic bacterial infection. Both Pulsatilla Decoction (abbreviated to PD, a traditional Chinese medicine compound) and Levofloxacin Hydrochloride (LVX) were known to have therapeutic effects to intestinal infectious disease. However, the changes of gut microbiota after PD or LVX treatment remain unclear. Herein, this work aimed to investigate the changes of intestinal flora after PD or LVX therapy of Escherichia coli infection in rats. Results revealed that PD exhibited a valid therapeutic approach for E. coli infection via the intestinal protection, as well as the inhibited release of IL-8 and ICAM-1. Besides, PD was beneficial to rebuild the gut microbiota via restoring Bacteroidetes spp in the composition of the gut microbiota. Comparatively, LVX treatment promoted the infection and ravaged gut microbiota by significantly decreasing Bacteroidetes and increasing Firmicutes. These findings not only highlight the mechanism of Chinese herbal formula, but extend the application of PD as veterinary medicine, feed additive and pre-mixing agent for improving the production of animal derived foods.

33390519|t|Identification of Phenolic Constituents and Inhibitory Activity of Persimmon Calyx and Shiteito against Tumor Cell Proliferation.
33390519|a|The persistent calyx on the fruit of Diospyros kaki, called "Shitei" in Japanese, is reported to contain phenolic compounds including condensed tannins. In this study, we isolated and characterized a new compound, together with 26 phenolic components, from the 70% acetone extract of Shitei, with structural elucidation based on spectroscopic analyses. In addition, we confirmed the presence of condensed tannins by (13)C-NMR spectra, and the weight-average molecular weight was estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Next, Shiteito, a Kampo medicine consisting of Shitei, ginger, and clove clinically used to treat chronic hiccoughs occurring in association with anticancer drug treatments, and hot-water extracts of each of its components, were analyzed by HPLC, which determined that the main ingredient in Shiteito was derived from clove. We therefore isolated the ingredients and investigated their anti-tumor cell proliferative activity, together with Shiteito and Shitei extracts. As a result, Shiteito showed weak inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep3B) cell proliferation at a high concentration. In contrast, ellagic acid, one of the main constituents of Shiteito, showed significant cytotoxicity against Hep3B cells, and significant inhibition of gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction of the 70% acetone extract of Shitei significantly inhibited the proliferation of colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) and AGS cells at low to middle concentration, while showing strong cytotoxicity against Hep3B. These data indicate that Shiteito and Shitei extracts could enhance cancer drug treatment by preventing the associated chronic hiccups, and have the potential to be adjuvant treatments as well.

26016454|t|Xijiao Dihuang Decoction () and Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. protect mice against lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced acute liver failure.
26016454|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hepatoprotective effect of Xijiao Dihuang Decoction (, XJDHD) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced acute liver failure (ALF) as well as the underlying mechanism of action, and to clarify the key herbs and components of XJDHD. METHODS: LPS/D-galactosamine (D-GalN) or TNF-alpha/D-GalN were intraperitoneally injected into C57BL/6J mice to induce ALF. Simultaneously, XJDHD or its individual herbs and components were orally administered. Survival rates, transaminase levels in serum, and hepatic histology were examined to evaluate the effects of XJDHD. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction were additionally performed to expound the mechanism underlying the anti-apoptotic activity of XJDHD. RESULTS: Oral administration of XJDHD protected mice from lethal liver failure induced by LPS and TNF-alpha, with notable amelioration of liver injury in histology and a significant decrease in transaminase levels in serum. XJDHD significantly inhibited apoptosis of hepatocytes and enhanced expression of the antiapoptosis genes, c-Flip, Iap1, Gadd45b and A20. In addition, Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. was identified as the key herb of XJDHD and galactose as the effective component of Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. that protects against ALF. CONCLUSIONS: XJDHD inhibits TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes by promoting the expression of nuclear factor kappa B-regulated anti-apoptotic genes. Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. is the effective herb of XJDHD and galactose is an active component in this protection.

34808298|t|Zuojin Pill attenuates Helicobacter pylori-induced chronic atrophic gastritis in rats and improves gastric epithelial cells function in GES-1 cells.
34808298|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zuojin pill (ZJP), a classical Chinese medicine formula, has been widely applied in Chinese clinical practice for the treatment of gastric injury such as acute gastric lesion, acute gastric mucosal injury, chronic unpredictable mild stress, gastroesophageal reflux disease, etc, thereby exerting anti-chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) effects in traditional Chinese herbal medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was aimed to explore the therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms of ZJP on Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-induced CAG based on the comprehensive approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with H. pylori for 8 weeks to establish CAG model. Then, rats in the ZJP groups received doses of 0.63, 1.26, and 2.52 g/kg ZJP for 4 weeks. Therapeutic effects of ZJP on serum indices and the histopathology of the gastric were analyzed in vivo. Moreover, GES-1 cells were infected with H. pylori to establish gastric epithelial cell injury model in vitro. Cell viability and gastric epithelial cell morphology were detected by a high-content screening (HCS) assay. Furthermore, the relative mRNA and protein expression of JMJD2B/COX-2/VEGF axis and HMGB1/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro were determined by RT-PCR and Western Blotting, respectively. RESULTS: The results showed that the therapeutic effects of ZJP on CAG rats were presented in down-regulation serum biochemical indices and alleviating histological damage of gastric tissue. ZJP could dose-dependently decrease the serum IL-6, MCP-1, PGE2, TNF-alpha, and VEGF level and significantly improved gastric tissue inflammatory lesions. Besides, ZJP has an effect on increasing cell proliferation of GES-1 cells, ameliorating H. pylori-induced gastric epithelial cell damage. It was found that ZJP has a down-regulating effect on inflammatory reaction and could inhibit the relative mRNA and protein expression of JMJD2B/COX-2/VEGF axis and HMGB1/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro, including JMJD2B, COX-2, VEGF, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2, which in turn reduced the damage of gastric mucosal cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that ZJP exerts therapeutic effects on H. pylori-induced CAG by inhibiting the JMJD2B/COX-2/VEGF axis and HMGB1/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These findings deeply explained why ZJP could be used to treat CAG clinically and clarified its pharmacological effect and potential mechanism in the treatment of CAG.

18418968|t|[Effects of Danggui Buxue Decoction on liver fibrosis and hepatic lipid peroxidation in rats].
18418968|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Danggui Buxue Decoction (DBD) on liver fibrosis and to explore its mechanism related to hepatic lipid peroxidation in rats. METHODS: Liver fibrosis model was established in 28 rats by the combination of injecting carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) subcutaneously and feeding high lipid and low protein diet. The model rats were randomly divided into 2 groups, the model group (n = 14) and the treated group (n = 14). Besides, a normal group was set up with 10 normal rats. For the treated group, rats were administered with DBD at a dosage of 6 g/kg body weight once a day by gastrogavage starting from the day of modeling for 6 successive weeks and to the control group, equal volume of normal saline was administered instead. The inflammation and fatty degeneration in rat liver tissues were examined with HE staining; the collagen deposition observed with sirius red; the liver function including serum level of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (Alb) and total bilirubin (TBil) were determined using corresponding test kits; the hepatic lipid peroxidation indexes, including triglyceride (TG), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by biochemical methods; the hepatic hydroxyproline (Hyp) content was detected with Jamall's method and the expression of collagen type I was analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Compared with those in the normal rats, serum ALT, AST, TBil level, TG and MDA content remarkablely increased, level of Alb and SOD activity decreased, and hepatic fatty degeneration and collagen pathological deposition in liver was more obvious in the model rats (all P < 0.05). While in the DBD group, the hepatic fatty degeneration and collagen deposition were significantly improved, changes of all the above-mentioned indexes were significantly reversed (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: DBD has a good antagonist effect against experimental liver fibrosis, and its mechanism may be related to the anti-lipid peroxidation injury effect.

9358907|t|Comparative study of oral and parenteral administration of sho-saiko-to (xiao-chaihu-tang) extract on D-galactosamine-induced liver injury in rats.
9358907|a|The preventive effect of Sho-saiko-to (Xiao-Chaihu-Tang) extract (TJ-9) on the progression of D-galactosamine (GaIN)-induced liver injury was examined in five week-old male Wistar rats with oral (p.o.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the same dose of TJ-9. Rats treated once with GaIN (500 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) received TJ-9 at a dose of 1.0 g/kg body weight (p.o. or i.p.) 2 hours after GaIN treatment at which time an apparent liver injury occurred. Both p.o. and i.p. administration of TJ-9 showed similar significant prevention against the progression of liver injury 24 hours after GaIN injection. Although total protein and albumin concentrations in serum and protein concentration in the liver decreased with the progression of GaIN-induced liver injury, oral or i.p. administration of TJ-9 prevented these decreases in similar degree. However, decreases in serum and liver triglyceride concentration with the progression of liver injury were not attenuated after p.o. or i.p. administration of TJ-9. The activities of liver 5'-nucleotidase and glucose-6-phosphatase, marker enzymes of liver plasma and microsomal membranes, respectively, decreased during the progression of liver injury. A similar preventive effect on the decrease of both enzyme activities was found after p.o. or i.p. administration of TJ-9. These results indicate that the preventive effect on progression of GaIN-induced liver injury by oral or i.p. administration is approximately equal, and that the effect may be through improving the impaired liver protein synthesis and disrupted liver plasma and microsomal membranes in a similar degree.

26955683|t|[Effects of Xuefu Zhuyu Granule and Danlou Tablet on Anti-atherosclerosis Rats and Potential Mechanisms].
26955683|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe anti-atherosclerotic effect of Xuefu Zhuyu Granule (XZU) and Danlou Tablet (DT) on blood lipids, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal pathway in atherosclerosis (AS) model rats, and to explore their potential mechanisms. METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups, i.e., the normal control group, the model group, the Atorvastatin group, the DT group, the XZG group, 8 in each group. Rats in the normal control group were fed with basic forage for 12 weeks, while rats in the other four groups were fed with high fat forage plus intraperitoneal injection of vitamin D3 to build AS model. Then rats in the model control group, the Atorvastatin group, the DT group, the XZG group were administered with normal saline, Atorvastatin suspension (0.18 mg/mL), DT suspension (45 mg/mL), and XZG (1 g/mL) by gastrogavage for 8 successive weeks, respectively. After intervention serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, and PDGF were detected by ELISA. Pathological changes in thoracic aorta were observed by HE staining. Protein expression levels of ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 in thoracic aorta were measured by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, serum TC, TG, LDL-C, PDGF levels, and expression levels of ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 significantly increased (P <0. 05) in the model control group. HE staining showed irregular intimal thickness, accumulated endothelial foam cells, lipids deposited, disarranged media VSMCs, forming typical AS plaque. Compared with the model group, TC and PDGF levels decreased in all medicated groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Serum levels of TG and LDL-C significantly decreased in the Atorvastatin group and the DT group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Expressions of ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 significantly decreased in the Atorvastatin group, the DT group, and the XZG group (P < 0.01). HE staining also showed typical AS plaque in three medicated groups, but with reduced pathological degree of endometrial hyperplasia and plaque area. CONCLUSIONS: XZG and DT could reduce the plaque area and attenuate pathological degree of AS in model rats, thereby postponing the progress of AS. Its mechanism might be achieved through reducing serum lipids and release of PDGF, inhibiting ERK signal pathway activation and VSMC proliferation.

34737698|t|Network Pharmacology-Based Identification of Key Mechanisms of Xihuang Pill in the Treatment of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Stem Cells.
34737698|a|Xihuang pill, an approved Chinese medicine formula (state medical permit number. Z11020073), is a commonly used adjuvant drug for cancer patients in China. Xihuang pill has a satisfactory effect in treating breast cancer in clinics, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is the most aggressive type of breast cancer, and finite effective therapies. However, the mechanism of Xihuang pill in treating TNBC remains unclear. The present study aims to explore the pharmacological mechanism of Xihuang pill in treating advanced TNBC. We identified the main chemical components of Xihuang pill by using HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) analysis shows that serum containing Xihuang pill (XS) had no obvious killing effect on any subtype of breast cancer cells, but it inhibited mammosphere colony formation of two TNBC cell lines (4T1 and HCC1806 cells) and could enhance the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel (PTX) on the proliferation of 4T1 and HCC1806 cells when combined with PTX. Seventy-six active compounds in Xihuang pill, their 300 protein targets, and 16667 TNBC stem cell-related genes were identified. The drug-herb-active compound-target gene-disease network and enrichment analyses were constructed with 190 overlapping candidate targets. Through text mining and molecular docking, the target gene NR3C2 and its active compound naringenin were selected for further validation. According to the TCGA database, we observed that a high expression of NR3C2 promoted a higher survival probability regarding overall survival (OS). In vitro experiments indicated that naringenin presented an identical effect to XS, possibly by regulating the NR3C2 expression. Overall, this study explored the effect of Xihuang pill in treating advanced TNBC cells and showed that naringenin, which is the key active compound of Xihuang pill, could lessen the stemness of TNBC cells to produce a synergistic effect on PTX by regulating the NR3C2 gene.

31055001|t|Aqueous extract from You-Gui-Yin ameliorates cognitive impairment of chronic renal failure mice through targeting hippocampal CaMKIIalpha/CREB/BDNF and EPO/EPOR pathways.
31055001|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: You-Gui-Yin (YGY) is a traditional Chinese recipe used for reinforcing kidney essence which is recorded in Jingyue Quanshu written by Zhang Jingyue in Ming dynasty. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, kidney essence is associated with brain and without sufficient kidney essence, cognitive impairment may occur. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of YGY extract on cognitive impairment of chronic renal failure (CRF) mice and explore the mechanisms involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous extract of YGY was prepared from crude drugs and was quality controlled by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). CRF was induced by 0.2% adenine in mice and CRF mice were intragastrically administered with 1.5gkg(-1), 3.0gkg(-1), and 6.0gkg(-1) of YGY extract. Mice were identified with CRF by determining several biochemical and physiological indexes, including creatinine clearance rate, serum creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, serum Ca, serum P, serum Mg, body weight and body temperature. Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests were conducted for evaluation of cognitive function. In addition, changes of CaMKIIalpha/CREB/BDNF and EPO/EPOR pathways in hippocampus were examined by detecting the protein expressions of CaMKIIalpha, p-CaMKIIalpha (Thr286), CREB1, p-CREB1 (Ser133), BDNF, EPO, EPOR, p-EPOR (Tyr485), STAT5, and AKT1 using western blotting assays. Also, the primary EPO-producing cells in brain (i.e. astrocytes) and EPO expression regulator HIF-2alpha were checked by fluorescence microscopy and western blotting assay, respectively. RESULTS: Nine components in YGY extract were figured out and monitored with their contents by HPLC for the quality control of YGY extract. Biochemical and physiological measurements validated the success of induction of CRF in mice, and YGY extract significantly retarded the CRF progression and ameliorated the CRF-induced cognitive impairment. The behavioral tests showed that compared with normal control mice, CRF mice had impaired cognitive function. However, treatment of YGY extract significantly ameliorated the cognitive impairment of CRF mice. Additionally, decreased expressions of hippocampal CaMKIIalpha, p-CaMKIIalpha (Thr286), CREB1, p-CREB1 (Ser133), and BDNF were observed in the hippocampus of CRF mice, but YGY extract significantly restored these protein expressions. Moreover, hippocampal EPO, EPOR, p-EPOR (Tyr485), STAT5, AKT1, and HIF-2alpha, as well as the number of astrocytes in CA1 zone of hippocampus were also decreased in CRF mice, while YGY extract prominently promoted the expressions of these proteins and increased the number of astrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: All the data in this study suggested that YGY extract ameliorated the cognitive impairment of CRF mice, and this amelioration was related to up-regulating the CaMKIIalpha/CREB/BDNF and EPO/EPOR pathways.

27200101|t|Shengmai San Ameliorates Myocardial Dysfunction and Fibrosis in Diabetic db/db Mice.
27200101|a|In this study, we mainly investigated the effects of Shengmai San (SMS) on diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) in db/db mice. The db/db mice were randomly divided into model group and SMS group, while C57BLKS/J inbred mice were used as controls. After 24-week treatment, blood glucose, body weight, and heart weight were determined. Hemodynamic changes in the left ventricle were measured using catheterization. The myocardial structure and subcellular structural changes were observed by HE staining and electron microscopy; the myocardium collagen content was quantified by Masson staining. To further explore the protective mechanism of SMS, we analyzed the expression profiles of fibrotic related proteins. Compared to nondiabetic mice, db/db mice exhibited enhanced diastolic myocardial dysfunction and adverse structural remodeling. Higher expression of profibrotic proteins and lower levels of extracellular matrix degradation were also observed. After SMS oral administration for 24 weeks, cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, and fibrosis in diabetic mice were greatly improved. Moreover, increased profibrotic protein expression was strongly reversed by SMS treatment in db/db mice. The results demonstrate that SMS exerts a cardioprotective effect against DCM by attenuating myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis via a TGF-beta dependent pathway.

21315142|t|Traditional Chinese medicine, Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu decoction, potentiates tissue plasminogen activator against thromboembolic stroke in rats.
21315142|a|AIM OF THIS STUDY: The Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu decoction (XFZYD) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine for treating cardiovascular diseases. The therapeutic effects of this XFZYD have been well documented especially in treating of atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia. Since this decoction can induce endothelial progenitor cell angiogenesis, it can provide experimental evidence for the treatment of ischemic diseases. Patients who are admitted to the hospital with acute ischemic stroke are initially considered candidates for the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). However, rt-PA therapy is still lesser than ideal due to its major side effect of hemorrhaging. Therefore, medical research has been devoted to finding an alternative and/or complementary therapy for ischemic stroke. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effect of the combination of XFZYD with or without rt-PA in a rat model of thromboembolic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cerebral thromboembolic stroke animal model and immunoblotting analysis were used to assess the effects of XFZYD and rt-PA. RESULTS: Treatment with rt-PA (8 mg/kg) or XFZYD (1.5 and 3.0 g/kg/day) alone showed slight reductions in the infarct volume compared to solvent-treated rats. However, XFZYD (1.5 and 3.0 g/kg/day) obviously potentiated rt-PA-mediated reduction in the infarct volume in cerebral ischemic regions. In addition, treatment with rt-PA significantly reduced both tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) but not hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha or active caspase-3 expressions in ischemic regions, whereas treatment with XFZYD (3.0 g/kg/day) significantly reduced all of these protein expressions in ischemic regions. Moreover, treatment with XFZYD (1.5 and 3.0 g/kg/day) obviously potentiated rt-PA-mediated reductions in TNF-alpha, iNOS, HIF-1 alpha, and active caspase-3 expressions. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that XFZYD potentiated rt-PA-mediated neuroprotection against thromboembolic stroke in rats. This neuroprotection is probably mediated by the inhibition of HIF-1 alpha and TNF-alpha, followed by the inhibition of inflammatory responses (i.e., iNOS) and apoptosis (active caspase-3). These results provide a better understanding of the scientific validation of the therapeutic value of the combination of XFZYD with rt-PA in ischemic stroke.

32677955|t|YYFZBJS ameliorates colorectal cancer progression in Apc(Min/+) mice by remodeling gut microbiota and inhibiting regulatory T-cell generation.
32677955|a|BACKGROUND: Progression of Colorectal cancer (CRC) is influenced by single or compounded environmental factors. Accumulating evidence shows that microbiota can influence the outcome of cancer immunotherapy. T cell, one of the main populations of effector immune cells in antitumor immunity, has been considered as a double-edged sword during the progression of CRC. Our previous studies indicate that traditional Chinese herbs (TCM) have potential anticancer effects in improving quality of life and therapeutic effect. However, little is known about the mechanism of TCM formula in cancer prevention. METHODS: Here, we used C57BL/6 J Apc(Min/+) mice, an animal model of human intestinal tumorigenesis, to investigate the gut bacterial diversity and their mechanisms of action in gastrointestinal adenomas, and to evaluate the effects of Yi-Yi-Fu-Zi-Bai-Jiang-San (YYFZBJS) on of colon carcinogenesis in vivo and in vitro. Through human-into-mice fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments from YYFZBJS volunteers or control donors, we were able to differentially modulate the tumor microbiome and affect tumor growth as well as tumor immune infiltration. RESULTS: We report herein, YYFZBJS treatment blocked tumor initiation and progression in Apc(Min/+) mice with less change of body weight and increased immune function. Moreover, diversity analysis of fecal samples demonstrated that YYFZBJS regulated animal's natural gut flora, including Bacteroides fragilis, Lachnospiraceae and so on. Intestinal tumors from conventional and germ-free mice fed with stool from YYFZBJS volunteers had been decreased. Some inflammation' expression also have been regulated by the gut microbiota mediated immune cells. Intestinal lymphatic, and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), accumulated CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3 positive Treg cells were reduced by YYFZBJS treatment in Apc(Min/+) mice. Although YYFZBJS had no inhibition on CRC cell proliferation by itself, the altered Tregs mediated by YYFZBJS repressed CRC cancer cell growth, along with reduction of the phosphorylation of beta-catenin. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we demonstrated that gut microbiota and Treg were involved in CRC development and progression, and we propose YYFZBJS as a new potential drug option for the treatment of CRC.

31662780|t|Spectrum-Effect Relationship between UPLC Fingerprints and Antilung Cancer Effect of Si Jun Zi Tang.
31662780|a|Nowadays, an increasing number of patients are seriously affected by lung cancer. Si Jun Zi Tang (SJZ), a four-herb Chinese medicine formula first described approximately one thousand years ago, is often prescribed for cancer patients as a complementary therapy. But the research on the effective materials for treating cancer using SJZ was rarely reported. To solve this problem, we evaluate the inhibitory effect of 10 samples of SJZ from different origins on PC9 cells. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) along with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and bioactivity validation were used to investigate the underlying correlation between the chemical ingredients and the antiproliferative effect of SJZ on PC9 cells. The evaluation indicated that 10 batches of SJZ could inhibit proliferation of PC9 cells and there was a notable difference in pharmacological activity between the different SJZ samples. The results of CCA and multivariate statistical analysis indicated that ginsenoside Ro and ginsenoside Rg1 might be active constituents of the antiproliferative effect as determined by spectrum-effect relationships. The results showed that bioassay and spectrum-effect relationships are suitable to associate sample quality with the active ingredient associated with clinical efficacy. And our finding would provide foundation and further understanding of the quality evaluation of traditional Chinese medicine decoction.

31355571|t|[Pharmacological mechanism of Shenghua Decoction in treatment of abdominal pain based on network pharmacology].
31355571|a|The Shenghua Decoction recorded in Fu Qing Zhu's Gynaecology,is a commonly used postpartum prescription,widely used in treating postpartum and gynecological diseases. However,its mechanism of action in treating lower abdominal pain remains unclear. In this paper,network pharmacology was used to explore the mechanism of Shenghua Decoction in the treatment of lower abdomen pain,so as to provide data support for better clinical application of Shenghua Decoction. The drug targets of lower abdominal pain and Shenghua Decoction were retrieved in SymMap. String and Cytoscape were adopted for enrichment analysis to construct the disease-drug-target biological network. Relevant gene search results showed that there were 400 targets in Shenghua Decoction,11 of which coincided with the disease genes of lower abdomen pain. In String analysis,18 gene interactions were obtained. Gene modularizationbased analysis results indicated that one module containing six genes was obtained after modularization processing. Furthermore,there were 170 enrichment results of biological process,2 enrichment results of molecular function and 30 enrichment results of KEGG pathways in String enrichment analysis. Shenghua Decoction may play a role in treating lower abdomen pain through neuro-endocrine-immune,metabolism and other means. Its mechanism may be achieved by accelerating the repair and growth of endometrial tissue cells,improving microcirculation,promoting endometrial cell renewal and inflammation subsidence,and accelerating uterine involution; at the same time,it can regulate the autoimmunity,regulate and control the function of some natural immune cells in the process of antiinfection by using signaling pathway,supplement the vital energy,and induce elimination of pathogens from the body,thereby achieving the effect of treating lower abdomen pain.

30131696|t|The WT1/MVP-Mediated Stabilization on mTOR/AKT Axis Enhances the Effects of Cisplatin in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer by a Reformulated Yu Ping Feng San Herbal Preparation.
30131696|a|Chemo-resistance is an obstacle in therapy of lung cancer. Alternative therapy of using herbal medicine has been proposed to resolve this obstacle. Yu Ping Feng San (YPFS), a common Chinese herbal medicinal mixture, has been reported to show anti-drug resistance on cisplatin (DDP), a common lung cancer drug. To optimize the anti-cancer function of YPFS, different Chinese herbal extracts having known function to overcome lung cancer were screened in combining with YPFS, as to increase the efficacy of DDP in drug resistance lung cancer cell, A549/DDP. Amongst these herbal extracts, Ginkgo Folium exhibited the most promoting sensitized effect. This revised herbal formula, named as YPFS+GF, promoted the DDP-induced toxicity by over 2-fold as compared to that of YPFS alone; this potentiation was confirmed by inducing cell apoptosis. The anti-drug resistance of YPFS, triggered by an increase of intracellular concentration of DDP, was accompanied by an increased expression and activity of WT1, which consequently decreased the transcript level of MVP. In addition, the MVP-mediated downstream effector mTOR2/AKT was disrupted after application of YPFS+GF in DDP-treated A549/DDP cell: this disruption was characterized by the decline of mTORC2 components, e.g., Rictor, p-mTOR, as well as the phosphorylation level of its downstream protein AKT. The disruption on mTORC2/AKT could be reversed by mTORC2 inducer insulin and promoted by mTORC2 inhibitor PP242. Thus, the anti-drug resistance of YPFS+GF in DDP-treated lung cancer cells might be mediated by the down regulation of WT1/MVP axis, as well as the downstream anti-apoptotic pathway of mTORC2/AKT signaling. Herbal medicine is one of the main adjuvant therapies in non-small cell lung cancer, and this novel herbal formula supports the prescription of traditional Chinese medicine in cancer treatment.

33647776|t|Pharmacokinetics-based comprehensive strategy to identify multiple effective components in Huangqi decoction against liver fibrosis.
33647776|a|BACKGROUND: Huangqi decoction (HQD) has been used to treat chronic liver diseases since the 11th century, but the effective components in HQD against liver fibrosis have not been definitively clarified. PURPOSE: To investigate and identify multiple effective components in HQD against liver fibrosis using a pharmacokinetics-based comprehensive strategy. METHODS: The absorbed representative components in HQD and their metabolites were detected in human plasma and urine using high-resolution mass spectrometry combined with a database-directed method, and then pharmacokinetics in multiple HQD components in human plasma was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadruple mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the anti-fibrotic effect of potential effective HQD components was studied in LX-2 cells and that of a multi-component combination of HQD (MCHD) was verified in a mouse CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis model. RESULTS: Twenty-four prototype components in HQD and 17 metabolites were identified in humans, and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 14 components were elucidated. Among these components, astragaloside IV, cycloastragenol, glycyrrhizic acid, glycyrrhetinic acid, liquiritigenin, and isoliquiritigenin downregulated the mRNA expression of alpha-SMA; cycloastragenol, calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside, formononetin, glycyrrhetinic acid, liquiritin, and isoliquiritin downregulated the mRNA expression of Col I; and calycosin, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, cycloastragenol, and glycyrrhetinic accelerated the apoptosis of LX-2 cells. MCHD reduced serum aminotransferase activity and hepatic collagen fibril deposition in mice with CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Using the pharmacokinetics-based comprehensive strategy, we revealed that multiple effective HQD components act together against liver fibrosis.

33328987|t|Da-Chai-Hu Decoction Ameliorates High Fat Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Through Remodeling the Gut Microbiota and Modulating the Serum Metabolism.
33328987|a|The dysbiosis in gut microbiota could affect host metabolism and contribute to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Da-Chai-Hu decoction (DCH) has demonstrated protective effects on NAFLD, however, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we established a NAFLD rat model using a high fat diet (HFD) and provided treatment with DCH. The changes in gut microbiota post DCH treatment were then investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Additionally, serum untargeted metabolomics were performed to examine the metabolic regulations of DCH on NAFLD. Our results showed that DCH treatment improved the dyslipidemia, insulin resistance (IR) and ameliorated pathological changes in NAFLD model rats. 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics showed significant dysfunction in gut microbiota community and serum metabolites in NAFLD model rats. DCH treatment restored the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and improved the dysfunction in serum metabolism. Correlation analysis indicated that the modulatory effects of DCH on the arachidonic acid (AA), glycine/serine/threonine, and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways were related to alterations in the abundance of Romboutsia, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, Lachnoclostridium and Enterobacteriaceae in the gut microflora. In conclusion, our study revealed the ameliorative effects of DCH on NAFLD and indicated that DCH's function on NAFLD may link to the improvement of the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the modulation of the AA, glycerophospholipid, and glycine/serine/threonine metabolic pathways.

33383311|t|Huang Lian Jie Du Tang attenuates paraquat-induced mitophagy in human SH-SY5Y cells: A traditional decoction with a novel therapeutic potential in treating Parkinson's disease.
33383311|a|Huang Lian Jie Du Tang (HLJDT) is a traditional Chinese medical decoction for heat-fire clearing and detoxication. Theoretically, the cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been attributed to the dysregulations of internal wind, phlegm, fire, and stasis. Thus, HLJDT has been used to treat PD. However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. Besides, paraquat (PQ) as an herbicide has been known to impair midbrain dopaminergic neurons, resemblance to the pathology of PD. Thus, the molecular mechanism of HLJDT in treating PD and PQ-induced in vitro PD model was investigated in this study. Primarily, the dose-response of PQ (0.1 approximately 1 mM)-induced neurotoxicity for 24 h was performed in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The LD50 of PQ is around 0.3 mM and was applied throughout the following experiments. The neutral red assay was used to estimate cell viability. Co-transfection of the mitochondrial marker and proapoptotic factor genes were applied to measure the release of mitochondrial proapoptotic factors during PQ intoxication and HLJDT protection. The fluorescent dyes were used to detect mitochondrial membrane potential and free radical formation. Western blot and dot-blot analysis and immunocytochemistry were used to estimate the level of proteins related to apoptosis and mitophagy. PINK1 gene silencing was used to determine the significance of mitophagy during PQ intoxication. In this study, HLJDT attenuated PQ-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. HLJDT reversed PQ-induced decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and suppressed PQ-induced increased cytosolic and mitochondrial free radical formations and mitochondrial proapoptotic factor releases. Furthermore, HLJDT mitigated PQ-induced increases in full-length PINK1, phosphorylations of Parkin and ubiquitin, mitochondrial translocation of phosphorylated Parkin, and mitophagy. PINK1 gene silencing attenuated PQ-induced neurotoxicity. Therefore, HLJDT attenuated PQ-induced cell death by regulating mitophagy.

29207093|t|Potential inhibitory effects of the traditional herbal prescription Hyangso-san against skin inflammation via inhibition of chemokine production and inactivation of STAT1 in HaCaT keratinocytes.
29207093|a|Inflammatory skin disease are caused by multiple factors, including susceptibility genes, and immunologic and environmental factors, and are characterized by an increase in epidermal thickness and the infiltration of macrophages, keratinocytes, mast cells, eosinophils and other inflammatory cells. Keratinocytes may serve an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases. The traditional herbal decoction Hyangsosan (HSS) has been used to treat symptoms of the common cold, including headache, pantalgia, fever and chills. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence regarding whether HSS has an effect on inflammatory skin diseases. The present study investigated the antiskin inflammation activity of HSS using the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. The mRNA expression and production of inflammatory chemokines, including CC motif chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22), CCL5, CCL17, and interleukin (IL)8, was measured using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and ELISA analyses. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of HSS on signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway in HaCaT cells. The cells were stimulated with tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFalpha) and interferongamma (IFNgamma) to induce an inflammatory reaction. In the TNFalpha and IFNgammastimulated cells, the production and expression of inflammatory chemokines were observed, including CCL22, CCL5, CCL17 and IL8. In addition, stimulation with TNFalpha and IFNgamma increased the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 in HaCaT cells. By contrast, HSS extract treatment inhibited TNFalpha and IFNgammainduced STAT1 activation. Results from the present study indicated that HSS exhibited inhibitory effects on TNFalpha and IFNgammamediated chemokine production and expression by targeting STAT1 in keratinocytes. Overall, the results indicated that HSS may be a potential candidate therapeutic drug for inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis.

22419424|t|The regulatory effect of liuwei dihuang pills on cytokines in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
22419424|a|The regulatory effect of Liuwei Dihuang Pills (LDP) was studied on cytokines in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for human multiple sclerosis (MS), induced by immunization with MOG(35-55) and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) supplemented with pertussis toxin (PTX). LDP was administrated orally for 40 days, and prednisone acetate (PA) was used as a control. The pathological changes in the spinal cords of mice were observed by light microscope with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The protein and mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the spinal cords were assessed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR assay, and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in mice plasma was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) on days 12, 25 and 40 post-immunization (PI). The results showed that inflammatory cells, demyelination and axonal loss were reduced, and that the protein and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and the ratio of TNF-alpha/TGF-beta were obviously decreased, to different extents. However, the levels of cAMP were enhanced in LDP-treated groups. These findings suggested that LDP regulates the cytokine balance in favor of T helper 1 (Th1)/regulatory T (Treg) cells, which depend on enhancement of cAMP levels. LDP has a potential role in the treatment of MS and other demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system.

32957919|t|The effects of the Xijiao Dihuang decoction combined with Yinqiao powder on miRNA-mRNA profiles in mice infected with influenza a virus.
32957919|a|BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play vital roles in acute inflammatory and antiviral responses during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. The Xijiao Dihuang decoction combined with Yinqiao powder (XDY) is applied to remedy viral pneumonia in China and its therapeutic efficacy in pneumonic mice challenged with IAV was demonstrated; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Thus, this study aimed to explore the miRNA-mRNA profiles in the lungs of IAV-infected mice and investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of XDY involving miRNAs and associated pathways. METHODS: We detected the cellular miRNA contents in the lungs of mice treated with XDY (23 g/kg/d) for A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) (FM1) infection at 4 days postinoculation (dpi) and 7 dpi. MiRNA and mRNA high-throughput sequencing analyses, and miRNA and mRNA qRT-PCR analyses were used to detect and verify the relevant miRNAs and mRNAs. Conjoint analysis, GO enrichment analysis, and KEGG database analysis were applied to identify the miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships. RESULTS: The quantities of differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs were upregulated over time. The data showed that 104 miRNAs and 3485 mRNAs were differentially expressed after challenge with FM1 on day 4, while 191 miRNAs and 6126 mRNAs were differentially expressed on day 7. The GO enrichment analysis and KEGG database data showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs were mainly enriched in JNK activity, MAPK phosphatase activity, and the TLR, Jak-STAT and TNF signalling pathways after treatment of FM1 infection with XDY. Generally, the expression trends of differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs based on the qRT-PCR results exhibited good consistency with the results of the high-throughput sequencing analysis. CONCLUSIONS: MiRNAs and mRNAs were differentially expressed during FM1 infection. The therapeutic mechanisms of XDY in FM1-infected mice, might be related to regulating antiviral immunity and ameliorating excessive inflammatory responses by modulating the expression of dysregulated miRNAs and mRNAs involved in the ERK/JNK-AP-1, and IFN-beta/STAT signalling pathways.

35097123|t|Investigating the Molecular Mechanism of Xijiao Dihuang Decoction for the Treatment of SLE Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Analysis.
35097123|a|OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the main mechanism of Xijiao Dihuang decoction (XJDHT) for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: TCMSP, BATMAN-TCM, ETCM, and TCMID databases and literature search were used to screen the potential active compounds of XJDHT, and TCMSP and SwissProt databases were searched to predict the targets of the compounds. The targets of SLE were obtained from Genegards, OMIM, and DisGeNET databases, and Venn online platform was used to obtain the intersection targets of XJDHT and SLE. Afterwards, the PPI network was constructed by using the STRING database, and the core targets were identified by network topology analysis. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed through R software, and molecular docking of the top three core targets and their corresponding compounds were accomplished by Autodock Vina and Pymol softwares. RESULTS: There were 30 potential active ingredients, 289 potential targets, and 129 intersection targets screened from the above databases. Network topology analysis identified 23 core targets, such as AKT1, TNF, IL6, IL1B, and INS. GO enrichment analysis obtained 2555 terms and mainly clustering on the react to lipopolysaccharide, membrane raft, and ubiquitin-like protein ligase binding. KEGG enrichment analysis obtained 187 signaling pathways, mainly concentrating on the lipid and atherosclerosis, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, fluid shear stress, and atherosclerosis. Molecular docking verified that the active compounds of XJDHT have the strong binding activity to the core targets. CONCLUSION: This study preliminarily uncovers the mechanism of XJDHT acting on SLE through a "multicompound, multitarget, and multipathway" manner. XJDHT may achieve the treatment of SLE by inhibiting the proinflammatory factors, inflammatory signal cvtokines, proliferation, injury, and apoptosis processes. In summary, the present study would provide a promising theoretical basis for further clinical and experimental studies.

34605344|t|Study on the mechanism of treating COVID-19 with Shenqi Wan based on network pharmacology.
34605344|a|PURPOSE: Through the method of network pharmacology, the active components and targets of Shenqi Wan (SQW) were excavated, the relationship with novel Coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) was discussed, and the possible mechanism of SQW in the treatment of COVID-19 was revealed from the aspects of multicomponents, multitargets, and multipathways. METHODS: Firstly, the active components of SQW were screened from traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform and the 2020 edition of Chinese Pharmacopeia, and the related targets of the components were obtained. Then the disease targets related to COVID-19 were screened from GeneCards and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. Venny was used to map the relationship between component-target and disease-target, and String was used to analyze the interaction of common targets. The network was constructed and analyzed by Cytoscape, the function of Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) genes was enriched by Metascape, and the molecular docking was verified by CB-Dock. RESULTS: Finally, 45 active components of SQW were obtained, and 72 potential targets were related to COVID-19, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), interleukin (IL)-6, nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) and, C-reactive protein (CRP),may be the key targets. GO enrichment of 1715 projects, such as lipopolysaccharide stress response, active oxygen metabolism, positive regulation of cell migration, and other GO enrichment. About 136 KEGG pathways, tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha signaling pathway were obtained. Molecular docking showed that kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin, astragaloside, calyx isoflavone glucoside, matrine, and other COVID-19-related targets such as ACE2, chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) have good binding ability. CONCLUSION: According to the above results, it is suggested that SQW may play a role in the treatment of COVID-19 by directly or indirectly combining kaempferol, quercetin, and luteolin with ACE2, 3CLpro, PLpro, and PTGS2 to regulate multiple biological functions and signaling pathways.

17061561|t|[Alteration of renal hemodynamic in adriamycin-induced nephrosis rats administrated with Wulingsan].
17061561|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of traditional classical compound Wulingsan on renal hemodynamic in rats with adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephrosis. METHOD: After establishing a model of rats with adriamycin-induced nephrosis, we administrated wulin-san to the ADR rats via oral gavage for four weeks and measured mean arterial blood preasure (MABP) with manometer. Renal clearance of paraaminohippuric acid (PAH) and inulin were detected, then renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were calculated. Renal vascular resistance (RVR) was calculated as the division of MABP by RPF. Renal endothelin (ET) and angiotensin II (Ang II) were detected with radioimmunity assay kits, and nitrous oxide (NO) was detected with biochemical kits. RESULT: There was no significant change of GFR in ARD rats, but RPF and NO were decreased, which accompanied by enhanced RVR, ET and Ang II. RPF was increased in the administrated rats, in company with RVR, ET and Ang II decreased, whereas NO was not influenced after the administration. CONCLUSION: Wulingsan can improve the renal hemodynamic in ADR rats, at least in part by modulating the levels of vasoactive factor.

32724826|t|A Network-Based Approach to Explore the Mechanism and Bioactive Compounds of Erzhi Pill against Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease.
32724826|a|Erzhi pill (EZP), a classical traditional Chinese medicine prescription, exerts a potent hepatoprotective effect against metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the mechanism and bioactive compounds underlying the hepatoprotective effect of EZP have not been fully elucidated. In this study, a systematic analytical platform was built to explore the mechanism and bioactive compounds of EZP against MAFLD. This was carried out through target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, gene ontology, KEGG pathway enrichment, and molecular docking. According to the topological parameters of the PPI network, compound-target-pathway network, 9 targets, and 11 bioactive compounds were identified as core targets and bioactive compounds for molecular docking. The results showed that EZP exerts anti-MAFLD effects through a multicomponent, multitarget, multipathway manner, and luteolin and linarin may be the bioactive compounds of EZP. This study provides further research insights and helps explore the hepatoprotective mechanism of EZP.

23245234|t|Urinary metabonomics characterization of liver fibrosis induced by CCl(4) in rats and intervention effects of Xia Yu Xue Decoction.
23245234|a|Xia Yu Xue Decoction (XYXD) is a traditional Chinese medicine which has been widely used in clinic practice for treating liver disease. However, its mechanism of action remains unknown. In this study, a urinary metabonomic method, based on gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS), was developed to investigate the effect of XYXD on liver fibrosis. Pattern recognition analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), showed that metabolic perturbations induced by CCl(4) were restored after treatment with XYXD. Ten potential biomarkers associated with modulation of energy metabolism, microflora metabolism, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism were identified, suggesting that the mechanism of action of XYXD may involve these processes. Our findings indicate that metabonomic methods based on GC/MS may provide a useful means of exploring biomarkers involved in liver fibrosis and for elucidating the mechanisms of action of therapies used in traditional Chinese medicine.

35571736|a|Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease with a long course which is often induced by an acute exacerbation of the disease by a respiratory tract infection. We aimed to explore the effect of Zhuye Shigao Decoction combined with Qingqi Huatan Pills on the regulation of the interleukin (IL)-6-mediated JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway in rats with an acute exacerbation of COPD (phlegm-heat stagnating in the lungs). A model of COPD rats with lung phlegm-heat stagnation was established by smoking and intratracheal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The rats were randomly divided into eight groups: normal control, model control, three doses of herbs group, and three doses of herbs + itacitinib groups. The lung function indexes were measured by using a lung function tester, and changes in pathological features of all groups were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The mRNA expression and protein expression levels in lung tissues were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blot, and immunohistochemical assay, respectively. Following treatment, IL-6 expression in lung tissues was significantly reduced compared with the model group. The results demonstrated that the medication was effective in alleviating the persistent airflow limitation and pathological features in COPD rats. Expression of JAK1/STAT3 in lung tissues was remarkably decreased. The JAK1/STAT3 pathway was inhibited, while SOCS3 expression was upregulated in the drug-treated groups compared with model control. However, after the addition of itacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor), the efficacy in each group was evidently impaired compared with herbs alone. Taken together, Zhuye Shigao Decoction combined with Qingqi Huatan Pills could improve the persistent airflow limitation and reduce lung inflammation and pathological changes of COPD possibly by regulating the expression of the IL-6-mediated JAK1/STAT3 pathway.

31572528|t|Sijunzi decoction may decrease apoptosis via stabilization of the extracellular matrix following cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion in rats.
31572528|a|Neurons undergo degeneration, apoptosis and death due to ischaemic stroke. The present study investigated the effect of Sijunzi decoction (SJZD), a type of traditional Chinese medicine known as invigorating spleen therapy, on anoikis (a type of apoptosis) in rat brains following cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion. Rats were randomly divided into sham, model, nimodipine and SJZD low/medium/high dose groups. A middle cerebral artery occlusion model was established. Neurobehavioural scores were evaluated after administration for 14 days using a five-grade scale. Blood-brain barrier permeability and apoptotic rate were detected using Evans blue (EB) extravasation and TUNEL staining, respectively. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and collagen IV (COL IV) were determined using immunohistochemistry. Neurobehavioural scores decreased remarkably in all SJZD and nimodipine groups compared to the model group (P<0.05). Compared with the sham group, EB extravasation was higher in the model group (P<0.01). The amount of EB extravasation decreased in the SJZD high dose and nimodipine groups compared to the model group (P<0.01), and extravasation in the SJZD high dose group was lower than the SJZD low and medium dose groups (P<0.01). TIMP-1 and MMP-9 expression and apoptotic rate increased, but COL IV decreased significantly in the hippocampus of the model group compared to the sham group (P<0.01). TIMP-1 and COL IV expression increased significantly and MMP-9 and apoptotic rate decreased remarkably in all SJZD and nimodipine groups compared to the model group (P<0.01). TIMP-1 and COL IV expression decreased, but MMP-9 expression and apoptotic rate increased in the SJZD low and medium dose groups compared to the SJZD high dose group (P<0.01). SJZD rescued neurons and improved neurobehavioural function in rats following cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion, especially when used at a high dose. The mechanism may be related to protection of the extracellular matrix followed by anti-apoptotic effects.

20881432|t|Sairei-to ameliorates rat peritoneal fibrosis partly through suppression of oxidative stress.
20881432|a|BACKGROUND: Sairei-to is a herbal prescription originating from traditional Chinese medicine. We conducted an experimental study on rat peritoneal fibrosis to clarify the suppressive mechanisms of sairei-to. METHODS: Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with chlorhexidine gluconate (CG) every day. Peritoneal specimens were collected after 28 days of CG injection and oral administration of sairei-to. Macrophage infiltration, extracellular matrix accumulation, and angiogenesis were evaluated by immunostaining for ED-1, fibronectin, and CD-31, respectively. To observe oxidative stress in the tissue, 4-hydroxy-2-noneal (HNE) accumulation and plasma levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were detected. As a candidate of antioxidative components in sairei-to, plasma levels of baicalin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Compared with the disease control group, serum total protein levels were significantly recovered in the sairei-to treatment group. Thickness of the submesothelial compact zone, trichrome-stained area, ED-1-positive cells, fibronectin-staining area, and HNE accumulation were suppressed in the treatment group. Concurrently, decreased plasma levels of SOD activity were recovered by sairei-to treatment. Increased CD-31-positive vessel number and area were also suppressed in the sairei-to group. Baicalin was detected in the plasma samples of the sairei-to group at 0.29 +/- 0.11 mug/ml (mean+/-SEM). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that sairei-to ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis, partly through suppressing oxidative stress and macrophage infiltration.

26242130|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the preventive effect different compatibilities of Ramulus Cinnamomi (RC) and peony in Guizhi Decoction (GD) on diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy (DCAN). METHODS: Totally 60 male rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, i.e., the blank control DM group, the model group, the methycobal group, the 1:1 (RC/peony) Guishao group, the 2:1 Guishao group, and the 1:2 Guishao group, 10 in each group. Rats were pretreated with corresponding drugs for 1 week, and then induced diabetes by intraperitoneal injection of STZ. Drugs were administrated by gastrogavage for 4 more weeks after STZ-injection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to detect levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (CHAT), nerve growth factor. (NGF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in myocardial homogenates. RESULTS: After 4-week modeling, body weight (BW) was obviously lower, but blood glucose (BG) was higher in STZ rats than in rats of the blank control DM group. There was no statistical difference in BW or BG among the 5 groups (P >0.05). Compared with the blank control group, TH, TH/CHAT, and NGF in left ventricle and ventricular septum increased, CHAT and CNTF increased in the model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, TH and TH/CHAT in left ventricle decreased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), CNTF in left ventricle increased (P < 0.05), CHAT in left ventricle and ventricular septum increased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) in the methycobal group. TH and TH/CHAT in left ventricle and ventricular septum decreased, CNTF in left ventricle and ventricular septum increased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), CHAT in left ventricle and ventricular septum increased (P < 0.01), NGF in ventricular septum decreased (P < 0.01) in the 1:1 Guishao group. TH/CHAT in left ventricle decreased (P < 0.01), CHAT and CNTF in left ventricle and ventricular septum increased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) in the 1:2 Guishao group. Compared with the methycobal group, CHAT in left ventricle decreased, TH and TH/CHAT in left ventricle increased in the 2:1 Guishao group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). TH and TH/CHAT in ventricular septum decreased (P < 0.05), CHAT and CNTF in left ventricle and ventricular septum increased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) in the 1:1 Guishao group. Compared with the 1:2 Guishao group and the 2:1 Guishao group, CHAT in left ventricle increased, TH/CHAT in left ventricle decreased, TH and TH/CHAT in ventricular septum decreased, CHAT in ventricular septum increased, CNTF in left ventricle and ventricular septum also increased in the 1:1 Guishao group (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: STZ model rats had autonomic neural injury, manifested as lowered vagal nerve activity and hyperactive sympathetic nerves. GD could effectively suppress hyperactive cardiac sympathetic nerves and protect the vagus. Besides, GD (1:1) showed the optimal effect in regulating the balance of cardiac autonomic nerves and could be used in early prevention of DCAN.

30619872|t|Herbal Medicine Ninjin'yoeito in the Treatment of Sarcopenia and Frailty.
30619872|a|Frailty and sarcopenia have recently gained considerable attention in terms of preventive care in Japan, which has an ever-increasing aging population. Sarcopenia is defined as atrophy of skeletal muscles caused by the age-related decrease in growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reports that frailty can lead to impairment of both mental and physical functioning. Chronic diseases such as diabetes and dementia may underlie frailty. It is important to prevent progression of frailty and extend the healthy lifespan. In herbal medicine practice, including Japanese Kampo medicine, "Mibyo," a presymptomatic state, has long been recognized and may be applicable to frailty. Kampo medicines may include several medicinal plants and are thought to have the potential to improve symptoms of frailty, such as loss of appetite and body weight, fatigue, and sarcopenia, as well as anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline. Ninjin'yoeito (Ren Shen Yang Ying Tang) is the most powerful Kampo medicine and has been widely applied to palliative care of cancer patients. This review includes recent anti-aging studies and describes the effects and mechanisms of Ninjin'yoeito (Ren Shen Yang Ying Tang) when used for frailty or to extend a healthy life expectancy.

33360842|t|Efficacy and safety of yinqiao powder combined with western medicine in the treatment of pneumonia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
33360842|a|OBJECTIVE: This review aimed at systematically evaluating the efficacy and safety of Yinqiao powder combined with western medicine in the treatment of pneumonia. METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on pneumonia treatment using a combination of Yinqiao powder and western medicine was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, Weipu (VIP) and CBM. The retrieval time limit was from the establishment of the database to June 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the bias risk of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULT: Fifteen RCTs involving 1705 patients were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis results revealed the total effective rate of the treatment group [RR = 1.21, 95% CI (1.15, 1.27), P < 0.00001], bacterial clearance rate [RR = 1.13, 95% CI (1.05, 1.22), P = 0.001], adverse reactions [RR = 0.54, 95% CI (0.38, 0.76), P = 0.0005]. There were statistically significant differences in the cooling time, T cell number, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) value decline rate (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the decline rate of neutrophils and leukocytes (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current evidence indicated that the Yinqiao powder combined with western medicine can improve total efficiency in the treatment of pneumonia patients. The combination therapy performed better when compared to western medicine alone in the cooling time, bacterial clearance rate, T cell count, decline rates of CRP and PCT as well as in the incidences of adverse reactions. However, there was no significant difference in the decline rates of neutrophils and leucocytes between the two groups. The funnel plot, Egger's test and Begg's test indicated publication bias, which may be associated with unpublished negative study results. Due to the limitation of the quality and quantity of the included studies, more high-quality studies should be performed to verify our conclusions.

1285129|t|Herbal medicine "sho-saiko-to" induces in vitro granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production on peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
1285129|a|The herbal medicine "Sho-saiko-to (Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang)" has been used in China for about 3000 years for the treatment of pyretic diseases. This medicine is now available as one of the prescribing drugs approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, and has also been widely used for patients with chronic viral liver disease as one of biological response modifiers in the field of Japan's Western Medicine. However, its mode of action has not been fully described. In the present in vitro study, we added "Sho-saiko-to" (TJ-9, Tsumura, Tokyo) to the culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy volunteers, and observed a dose-dependent increase in the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The same experiment was conducted using other herbal medicines "Dai-saiko-to" (TJ-8) and "Saiko-keishi-to" (TJ-10) which showed similar effects, or "Sho-seiryu-to" (TJ-19) which consists of very different compounds and shows different efficacy. The increases of G-CSF production were similar when "Sho-saiko-to" (TJ-9) or one of the 2 reference drugs (TJ-8 and 10) was added, whereas the increase when the control drug "Sho-seiryu-to" (TJ-19) was added, was quite small. This result shows that G-CSF induction is not a common effect of herbal medicines, but a specific effect of TJ-8, 9, and 10. Among these 3 drugs the increase produced by "Sho-saiko-to" was the largest. Based on this result, we conclude that administration of "Sho-saiko-to" may be useful not only for the treatment of chronic liver disease, but also for malignant diseases and acute infectious diseases where G-CSF is efficacious.

30867400|a|An eighty-nine-year-old Japanese male was admitted to our hospital due to dry cough and dyspnea. Respiratory symptoms appeared soon after an administration of an oriental medicine, Kamikihito for tinnitus. Upon admission, chest computed tomography showed patchy consolidations and ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe of the lungs, and ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lower lobes. Sulbactam-ampicillin combination (SBT/ABPC, 3 g x 2/day) was started in addition to the change or cessation of several other drugs, including Kamikihito, resulting in respiratory symptoms and chest radiographic exacerbations. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the right S(3) showed an increase in the total cell number of lymphocytes. A drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) for Kamikihito was also positive. Kamikihito-induced lung injury was most likely, and treatment with prednisolone (50 mg/day) was started. His respiratory symptoms and chest radiographic findings improved rapidly soon after initiating oral prednisolone. This is the first report of Kamikihito-induced lung injury.

29875658|t|Integration of Metabonomics and Transcriptomics Reveals the Therapeutic Effects and Mechanisms of Baoyuan Decoction for Myocardial Ischemia.
29875658|a|Myocardial ischemia (MI) is an escalating public health care burden worldwide. Baoyuan decoction (BYD) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula with cardioprotective activity; however, its pharmacological characteristics and mechanisms are obscured. Herein, a multi-omics strategy via incorporating the metabonomics, transcriptomics, and pharmacodynamics was adopted to investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of BYD for treating MI in a rat model of left anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA) ligation. The results indicated that BYD has a significantly cardioprotective role against MI by decreasing the infarct size, converting the echocardiographic abnormalities and myocardial enzyme markers, and reversing the serum metabolic disorders and myocardial transcriptional perturbations resulting from MI. Integrated bioinformatics analysis and literature reports constructed the interaction network based on the changes of the key MI targeted-metabolites and transcripts after BYD treatment and disclosed that the cardioprotection of BYD is mainly involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, cardiac contractile dysfunction, and extracellular matrix remodeling. The results of histopathological examination, quantitative RT-PCR assay, cardiac energy synthesis, and serum antioxidant assessment complemented the multi-omics findings, and indicated the multi-pathway modulation mechanisms of BYD. Our investigation demonstrated that the multi-omics approach could achieve a complementary and verified view for the comprehensive evaluation of therapeutic effects and complex mechanisms of TCMF like BYD.

34911662|t|Treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cerebellar infarction using the traditional herbal medicines banhabaekchulcheonma-tang and oryeong-san: Two case reports (CARE-complaint).
34911662|a|RATIONALE: Metoclopramide is commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting. However, long-term administration of metoclopramide is associated with various adverse effects, and its therapeutic effects are short-lasting. Hence, traditional East Asian medicine has received increasing attention as a short-term strategy for treating these symptoms. PATIENT CONCERNS: The present report discusses the cases of a 71-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman diagnosed with cerebellar infarction. Both patients reported nausea and vomiting, which appeared during hospitalization following cerebellar infarction. DIAGNOSES: One patient was diagnosed with a left cerebellar infarction and hemorrhagic transformation, while the other was diagnosed with a bilateral cerebellar infarction. INTERVENTIONS: Both patients took Banhabaekchulcheonma-tang (BT) and Oryeong-san (OS) extracts. OUTCOMES: The patient in Case 1 experienced a rapid decrease in nausea from day 5 of BT and OS administration, and metoclopramide was discontinued on day 7. The patient in Case 2 experienced a clear decrease in the number of vomiting episodes from day 6 of BT and OS administration and did not take metoclopramide thereafter. LESSONS: Other than drugs used to mitigate symptoms, there are no suitable treatments available for nausea and vomiting caused by cerebellar infarction. In the present cases, nausea and vomiting remained unresolved even after 3 weeks of treatment with conventional therapies; however, these symptoms significantly improved after administration of the traditional East Asian herbal medicines BT and OS, and there were no recurrences. These cases demonstrate that traditional herbal medicine can reduce the side effects associated with long-term administration of metoclopramide and help patients resume their daily lifestyle. In addition, BT and OS treatment can facilitate administration of other drugs, highlighting its potential to aid in the treatment of stroke. Further research including relevant clinical trials is required to obtain more conclusive evidence.

20226151|t|[Effects of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction on blood lipid metabolism and its related gene expressions in rats with hyperlipidemia].
20226151|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HJD), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on lipid metabolism and its related gene expressions in rats with hyperlipidemia. METHODS: Fifty SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group, untreated group, Lipitor (atorvastatin) group, and low- and high-dose HJD groups. Except the normal control group, rats in the other groups were fed with high-fat diet to induce hyperlipidemia. Then the rats were administered with corresponding drugs for 8 weeks. After treatment, the serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TAG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were assayed. The activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) in liver tissues were measured. Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) mRNA expressions in liver tissues were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the levels of serum TC, TAG and LDL-C in the untreated group were increased and the level of serum HDL-C was reduced. The activities of LPL and HL and expressions of LDLR and PPARgamma mRNAs in the untreated group were lower than those in the normal control group. After treatment, high-dose HJD significantly improved hyperlipemia by decreasing TC, TAG and LDL-C and increasing HDL-C. The activities of LPL and HL and expression levels of LDLR and PPARgamma mRNAs in liver tissues were also markedly enhanced in the high-dose HJD group as compared with those in the untreated group. CONCLUSION: HJD can activate the activity of lipid metabolism enzyme, and enhance the expressions of LDLR and PPARgamma mRNAs to modulate the lipid metabolic disorders in rats with hyperlipidemia.
