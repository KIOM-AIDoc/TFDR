28167974|t|Preventive Effects of a Chinese Herbal Formula, Shengjiang Xiexin Decoction, on Irinotecan-Induced Delayed-Onset Diarrhea in Rats.
28167974|a|Irinotecan is a well-known chemotherapy drug for the treatment of various cancers. However, delayed-onset diarrhea is a common adverse reaction, limiting the application of the drug. The study presented was designed to evaluate the preventive effects of Shengjiang Xiexin decoction (SXD) on irinotecan-induced diarrhea and to explore the possible mechanisms of this action. We established a diarrhea rat model. The condition of the rats was observed. The proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal cells were measured using immunohistochemical assays and a caspase-3 activity assay, respectively. The expression of Lgr5 and CD44 staining were used to observe intestinal stem cells (ISCs). In addition, the activity of beta-glucuronidase in the rats' feces was measured. Our results showed that the number of proliferating intestinal cells in the SXD groups was obviously higher, while the activity of caspase-3 was lower. The expression of Lgr5 and the integrated option density (IOD) of CD44 stain were increased significantly by SXD. Additionally, SXD decreased the activity of beta-glucuronidase after irinotecan administration. In conclusion, SXD exhibited preventive effects on irinotecan-induced diarrhea, and this action was associated with an inhibitory effect on intestinal apoptosis and beta-glucuronidase and a promotive effect on intestinal cell proliferation due to increased maintenance of ISCs.

33959000|t|Shaoyao Decoction Inhibits Inflammation and Improves Intestinal Barrier Function in Mice With Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis.
33959000|a|Shaoyao decoction (SYD), a classical traditional Chinese medicine formula, is effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study was designed to investigate the therapeutic effects of SYD on IBD and possible mechanisms. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 3.5%) was used to induce colitis in C57BL/6 mice. Disease phenotypes were investigated based on disease activity index (DAI), colon length, and microscopic and macroscopic scores. Additionally, the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, immune cell infiltrates, intestinal cell proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial permeability, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling, as well as the intestinal mucosal barrier function, were investigated. The administration of SYD significantly ameliorated the clinical signs, suppressed the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and reduced immune cell infiltrates into colonic tissues of DSS-induced colitis model mice. SYD also significantly reduced the DSS-induced activation of STAT3 and NF-kappaB signaling. Furthermore, SYD promoted epithelial integrity by regulating epithelial cell apoptosis and epithelial permeability. Finally, we demonstrated that SYD protected the intestinal barrier function by significantly regulating the mucus layer genes Muc1, Muc2, Muc4, and Tff3, as well as the epithelial barrier genes Z O -1 and Occludin. Our results indicate that SYD has a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis, which is attributable to its anti-inflammatory activity and intestinal barrier function-enhancing effects. These results provide valuable insights into the pharmacological actions of SYD for the treatment of IBD.

12687289|t|Preventive effect of Kampo medicine (Hangeshashin-to) against irinotecan-induced diarrhea in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
12687289|a|PURPOSE: Kampo medicine Hangeshashin-to (TJ-14) which contains baicalin, a beta-glucuronidase inhibitor, alleviates diarrhea induced by irinotecan (CPT-11). We conducted a randomized comparative trial to investigate whether support with TJ-14 would prevent and control CPT-11-induced diarrhea. METHODS: Of 44 previously untreated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer randomized, 41 (18 TJ-14 group, 23 control group) were available for evaluation. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of a combination of cisplatin and CPT-11. TJ-14 (7.5 g/day) was administered orally. RESULTS: Of the 41 patients, 39 experienced diarrhea. Compared with the control group, the TJ-14 group showed a significant improvement in diarrhea grades ( P=0.044) as well as a reduced frequency of diarrhea grades 3 and 4 (one patient versus ten patients; P=0.018). However, the two groups showed no differences in the frequency of diarrhea or the number of days the symptoms continued. This study was stopped at an interim evaluation. CONCLUSION: TJ-14 was effective in preventing and controlling CPT-11-induced diarrhea.

33787150|t|[Systematic evaluation and trial sequential analysis of Tianma Gouteng Granules combined with anti-hypertensive drugs in treatment of essential hypertension].
33787150|a|To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tianma Gouteng Granules combined with conventional anti-hypertensive drugs in the treatment of essential hypertension. The clinical randomized controlled trials(RCTs) on the treatment of essential hypertension with Tianma Gouteng Granules combined with conventional anti-hypertensive drugs were searched in PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, VIP, CNKI, Wanfang, SinoMed since the establishment of the databases to April 2020 based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and Meta-analysis was conducted by using RevMan 5.3 software. A total of 15 RCTs were included, involving a total of 1 508 patients. Meta-analysis results showed that Tianma Gouteng Granules combined with conventional Western medicine were supe-rior to the control group in reducing systolic blood pressure(MD=-10.24, 95%CI[-13.54,-6.95], P<0.000 01), diastolic blood pressure(MD=-5.33, 95%CI[-7.21,-3.45], P<0.000 01), improving the clinical efficacy of patients(RR=1.22, 95%CI[1.15, 1.28], P<0.000 01) and curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine syndrome(RR=1.26, 95%CI[1.02, 1.57], P=0.04), increasing nitric oxide content(MD=9.59, 95%CI[7.23, 11.96], P<0.000 01), reducing endothelin-1(MD=-10.74, 95%CI[-15.74,-5.75], P<0.000 1), tumor necrosis factor(MD=-0.28, 95%CI[-0.36,-0.19], P<0.000 01), and interleukin-6(MD=-39.71, 95%CI[-43.40,-36.03], P<0.000 01). There was no statistically significant difference between the test group and the control group in the incidence of adverse reactions. No liver and kidney dysfunction occurred. The results of the subgroup analysis showed that the effect of Tianma Gouteng Granules combined with ARB drugs was more obvious in reducing the systolic and diastolic pressure. Trial sequential analysis showed that the studies accumulatively included for clinical efficacy crossed the traditional threshold and the TSA threshold, further affirming its clinical efficacy. The clinical application of Tianma Gouteng Granules combined with conventional Western medicine in the treatment of primary hypertension and accompanying symptoms has clear efficacy and certain safety, so it is recommended for clinical application.

28752861|t|Kruppel-like factor 4 acts as a potential therapeutic target of Sijunzi decoction for treatment of colorectal cancer.
28752861|a|Sijunzi decoction (SJZD) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. Our study is aimed to identify the potential therapeutic target of SJZD. Microarray analysis was performed on the patients with colorectal cancer under treatment of SJZD. The mRNA targets of SJZD were predicted by BATMAN-TCM database and were further identified by integrated analysis of expression data from TCGA. The correlation of gene expression and clinical characteristics was analyzed. Microarray analysis indicated that Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) was significantly upregulated after intervention of SJZD. BATMAN-TCM prediction showed that KLF4 was an mRNA target of SJZD and it was downregulated in colorectal cancer by integrated analysis of expression data from TCGA. KLF4 may act as an administered indicator to assess whether adjuvant postoperative pharmaceutical therapy is needed for patients with colorectal cancer. Low KLF4 expression was significantly correlated with reductions of overall survival and recurrence rate. Our results suggested that KLF4 may be the potential therapeutic target of SJZD for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

9283216|a|To determine the effect of the Chinese herbal medicine, Sairei-to (TJ-114) in children with newly diagnosed IgA nephropathy showing focal/minimal mesangial proliferation, we undertook a prospective controlled study. One hundred and one patients were randomly assigned to receive Sairei-to for 2 years (group 1) or no drug for 2 years (group 2). Forty-six of the 50 patients in group 1 and 48 of the 51 patients in group 2 completed their trial. At entry, the two groups of patients did not differ in the clinical, laboratory and pathologic findings. At the end of the trial, urinary protein excretion and hematuria were significantly reduced in group 1, but were unchanged in group 2. Twenty-one group 1 patients (46%) had normal urine, but only 5 group 2 patients (10%) had normal urine at the end of the trial (p < 0.001). Blood pressure and creatinine clearance were normal at the end of the trial in all but one group 2 patient, who developed chronic renal failure. The present study demonstrates that 2-year Sairei-to treatment early in the course of disease is effective in children with IgA nephropathy showing focal/minimal mesangial proliferation.

25280587|t|Dohaekseunggi-tang extract inhibits obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.
25280587|a|BACKGROUND: Dohaekseunggi-tang (DHSGT) is a traditional plant-based medicine prescribed to promote blood circulation and to treat obesity and hypertension. The present study aimed to identify potential anti-obesity activities of DHSGT extract. METHODS: Anti-obesity, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-hypertensive effects of orally-administered DHSGT extract were evaluated in high-fat diet- (HFD)-induced obese mice. Serum biochemistry profiles and expression of diverse metabolic regulatory gene mRNAs in mouse visceral fat were assessed by RT-PCR. The effects of DHSGT on angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) and pancreatic lipase activities were determined using in vitro inhibition assays. RESULTS: Oral DHSGT treatment reduced obese HFD C57BL/6 J mouse body weight, liver and adipose tissue mass, adipocyte size, and blood pressure versus untreated HFD mice. DHSGT also decreased serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and leptin concentrations, and increased HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin levels in HFD mice. Furthermore, DHSGT markedly increased mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma, uncoupling protein-2, and adiponectin in visceral adipose tissue of HFD mice. In vitro tests revealed that DHSGT effectively inhibited porcine pancreatic lipase and ACE activities, with IC50 values of 7.58 mg/ml and 0.56 mg/ml, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results validate traditional knowledge and suggest that DHSGT may be potentially useful for managing hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and obesity.

35387334|t|Wu-Mei-Wan Ameliorates Murine Ulcerative Colitis by Regulating Macrophage Polarization.
35387334|a|An increasing body of evidence shows that macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). Macrophage polarization and changes in related signaling pathways are reported to have a protective effect on intestinal inflammation. The well-known Chinese medicine Wumeiwan (WMW) has been used to treat diarrhea, one of the main symptoms of colitis, for more than 2,000 years. Increasing evidence shows that WMW can inhibit intestinal inflammation and repair damaged intestinal mucosa, but its effector mechanisms are unknown. Therefore, we studied the prophylactic effects of WMW in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC and its effects on macrophage mechanisms and polarization. The results show that colitis was significantly alleviated in mice in the WMW group, and the secretion and expression of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 were inhibited in the serum and colonic tissues of mice with WMW-treated colitis, whereas anti-inflammatory factors IL-10, Arg-1, and TGF-beta1 were increased. Subsequent studies found that WMW could inhibit M1 polarization and promote M2 polarization in colonic macrophages in DSS-induced colitis mice. Network pharmacology was used to predict potential targets and pathways, and further studies confirmed the related targets The results showed that WMW gradually inhibits the activation of the P38MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways and further activates the STAT6 signaling pathway. In summary, WMW interferes with the p38MAPK, NF-kappaB and STAT6 signaling pathways to regulate M1/M2 polarization in macrophages, thereby protecting mice against DSS-induced colitis.

35539139|t|Serum metabolomics strategy for understanding the therapeutic effects of Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang against Yanghuang syndrome.
35539139|a|Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang (YCHT), a classic Chinese herbal formula, is characterized by its strong therapeutic effects of liver regulation and relief of jaundice, especially Yanghuang syndrome (YHS). YHS is a type of jaundice with damp-heat pathogenesis, and it is considered a complicated Chinese medicine syndrome (CMS). The accurate mechanism for healing YHS has not yet been completely reported. The purpose of the current research is to investigate the expression of endogenous biomarkers in YHS mice and evaluate the clinical therapeutic effect of YCHT. Serum samples were analyzed using UPLC-Q/TOF-MS techniques in order to determine differential metabolites to elucidate the functional mechanism of YCHT on YHS through metabolite profiling combined with multivariate analysis. Simultaneously, the exact diversification of YHS mice was elucidated using blood biochemistry indexes and histopathological examination, and the results indicated that YHS is markedly improved by YCHT. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) patterns were constructed to dissect the variances of metabolic profiling. Overall, 22 potential biomarkers were identified using a metabolomics approach based on an accurate MS/MS approach, clustering and distinguishing analysis. The present work demonstrates that the effectiveness of YCHT against YHS prompts distinct discrepancies in metabolic profiles by adjusting biomarkers and regulating metabolic disorders. A total of 15 metabolic pathways were involved in biological disturbance. This demonstrates that metabolomic techniques are powerful means to explore the pathogenesis of CMS and the therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese formulae.

29867509|t|Yinchenhao Decoction Ameliorates Alpha-Naphthylisothiocyanate Induced Intrahepatic Cholestasis in Rats by Regulating Phase II Metabolic Enzymes and Transporters.
29867509|a|Yinchenhao Decoction (YCHD), a famous traditional Chinese formula, has been used for treating cholestasis for 1000s of years. The cholagogic effect of YCHD has been widely reported, but its pharmacodynamic material and underlying therapeutic mechanism remain unclear. By using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, 11 original active components and eight phase II metabolites were detected in rats after oral administration of YCHD, including three new phase II metabolites. And it indicated that phase II metabolism was one of the major metabolic pathway for most active components in YCHD, which was similar to the metabolism process of bilirubin. It arouses our curiosity that whether the metabolism process of YCHD has any relationship with its cholagogic effects. So, a new method for simultaneous quantitation of eight active components and four phase II metabolites of rhein, emodin, genipin, and capillarisin has been developed and applied for their pharmacokinetic study in both normal and alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced intrahepatic cholestasis rats. The results indicated the pharmacokinetic behaviors of most components of YCHD were inhibited, which was hypothesized to be related to different levels of metabolic enzymes and transporters in rat liver. So dynamic changes of intrahepatic enzyme expression in cholestasis and YCHD treated rats have been monitored by an UHPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method. The results showed expression levels of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1 (UGT1A1), organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A4 (OATP1A4), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), multidrug resistance protein 1, sodium-dependent taurocholate cotransporter, and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 were significantly inhibited in cholestasis rats, which would account for reducing the drug absorption and the metabolic process of YCHD in cholestatic rats. A high dose (12 g/kg) of YCHD remarkably increased the expression of UGT1A1, bile salt export pump, MRP2, OATP1A4 in cholestasis rats presented it exhibited the greatest ameliorative effect on cholestasis, also particularly in histopathological examination and reducing levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and total bile acid. Considering the metabolic process of bilirubin in vivo, the choleretic effect of YCHD is proven to be related to its regulatory action on expression of metabolic enzymes and transporters in cholestatic liver.

19861507|t|Proteomic Analysis of Anti-inflammatory Effects of a Kampo (Japanese Herbal) Medicine "Shoseiryuto (Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang)" on Airway Inflammation in a Mouse Model.
19861507|a|Effects of a Kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine "shoseiryuto (SST, xiao-qing-long-tang in Chinese)", which has been used for the treatment of allergic bronchial asthma clinically, were examined on ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized allergic airway inflammation model (i.e., bronchial asthma) in a mouse. When SST was orally administered at 0.5 g kg(-1) day(-1) from day 1 to 6 after OVA inhalation, SST reduced the inflammation in lung tissue, the number of eosinophils and the OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody titer in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids at 7 days after the OVA inhalation. SST also reduced the airway hyperreactivity at 6 days after the OVA inhalation. Proteomic analysis with the agarose two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that the expression of spectrin alpha2 was reduced in the lung tissue of OVA-sensitized mice and SST recovered the expression. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of lung tissue also confirmed this result. When prednisolone was orally administered at 3 mg kg(-1) day(-1) from day 1 to 6 after OVA inhalation, the inflammation in lung tissue, the number of eosinophils in BAL fluids and airway hyperreactivity were reduced in the OVA-sensitized mice. However, prednisolone did not reduce the OVA-specific IgE antibody titer in BAL fluids and did not recover the expression of spectrin alpha2 in lung tissue. These results suggest that at least a part of action mechanism of SST against OVA-sensitized allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model is different from that of prednisolone.

32754049|t|Sishen Pill Treatment of DSS-Induced Colitis via Regulating Interaction With Inflammatory Dendritic Cells and Gut Microbiota.
32754049|a|Sishen Pill (SSP) is a typical prescription in the pharmacopeia of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and is usually used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is known that inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) and imbalance of gut microbiota play significant roles in the pathogenesis of IBD. However, it is not clear whether SSP can treat IBD by regulating interaction of DCs and gut microbiota. In the present study, the levels of inflammatory DCs and gut microbiota were analyzed by flow cytometry and 16S rDNA analysis. SSP relieved the pathological damage to the colon of mice with colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). As typical indicators of inflammatory DCs, the levels of CD11c(+)CD103(+)E-cadherin(+) cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1beta, -4, -9, and -17A] were decreased in mice with colitis treated by SSP for 10 days. Simultaneously, the gut microbiota composition was regulated, and beneficial bacteria were increased and pathogenic bacteria were reduced. The results indicated that SSP regulated the interaction between inflammatory DCs and gut microbiota to treat DSS-induced colitis.

27812119|t|Daesiho-Tang Is an Effective Herbal Formulation in Attenuation of Obesity in Mice through Alteration of Gene Expression and Modulation of Intestinal Microbiota.
27812119|a|BACKGROUND: Obesity has become a major global health challenge due to its increasing prevalence, and the associated health risk. It is the main cause of various metabolic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke and certain forms of cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study we evaluated the anti-obesity property of Daesiho-tang (DSHT), an herbal medicine, using high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice as a model. Our results showed that DSHT ameliorated body weight gain, decreased total body fat, regulated expression of leptin and adiponectin genes of adipose tissue and exerted an anti-diabetic effect by attenuating fasting glucose level and serum insulin level in HFD-fed animals. In addition, DSHT-treatment significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and increased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) levels in serum and reduced deposition of fat droplets in liver. DSHT treatment resulted in significantly increased relative abundance of bacteria including Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, Akkermansia Bifidobacterium., Lactobacillus, and decreased the level of Firmicutes. Using RT2 profiler PCR array, 39 (46%) genes were found to be differentially expressed in HFD-fed mice compared to normal control. However, normal gene expressions were restored in 36 (92%) genes of HFD-fed mice, when co-exposed to DSHT. CONCLUSION/MAJOR FINDINGS: The results of this study demonstrated that DSHT is an effective herbal formulation in attenuation of obesity in HFD-fed mice through alteration of gene expressions and modulation of intestinal microbiota.

20671770|t|Mao-to Prolongs the Survival of and Reduces TNF-alpha Expression in Mice with Viral Myocarditis.
20671770|a|Goal of this study was to evaluate effects of Mao-to on development of myocarditis induced by encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus in mice. Mice were randomly divided into five groups. Group N included uninfected controls (n = 18), while group A, B and C underwent intraperitoneal injection of EMC virus. Group A was administered oral saline from day 0 to day 4. Group B was administered oral Mao-to (500 mg(-1) kg(-1) day(-1)) from day 0 to day 4. Group C was administered Mao-to from day 2 to day 6. Group D was administered Mao-to from day 5 to day 10. Treated mice were followed for survival rates during 2 weeks after infection. Body weight (BW) and organ weights including heart (HW), lungs, thymus and spleen were examined on days 4, 6 and 14. Survival rate of group C (36.4%) was significantly improved compared with group A, B or D (0% of each, P < 0.05). HW and HW/BW ratio in group C was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those in group A, B or D. Viral titers of hearts were significantly different among groups A, B and C. Cardiac expression in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was significantly reduced in group C in comparison with group A, B or D on day 6 by immunohistochemical study. Administration of Mao-to starting on day 2 improves mortality resulting from viral myocarditis in mice with reduced expression of cardiac TNF-alpha. These findings suggest that timing of Mao-to is crucial for preventing cardiac damage in mice with viral myocarditis.

20428786|t|Alleviation of hepatic oxidative stress by Chinese herbal medicine Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang in obese mice with steatosis.
20428786|a|Obesity is associated with a complex systemic inflammatory state that has been implicated in the development of hepatic steatosis. This study was to test the efficacy of Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang (YCHT), an agent that improves hepatic triglyceride metabolism in its ability to modulate pathways implicated in hepatic steatosis. Mice were fed with high-fat diet for fifteen weeks. The therapeutic mechanism of YCHT likely enhanced adiponectin and endothelial progenitor cells, and up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma might be responsible for fatty liver diseases. In addition, YCHT anti-oxidative stress effect might be associated with inhibition of hepatic free fatty acid concentrations and elevation of the glutathione levels in hepatic tissues. Furthermore, YCHT action mechanisms might promote senescence marker protein-30 metabolism that increase resistance to hepatic oxidative stress. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic approach for fatty liver progression in obesity mice.

9436332|a|The patient was complicated by type C hepatitis considered dur to blood preparations during the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. On administration of Sho-saiko-to, the white blood cell count decreased. When the drug was administered again, interstitial pneumonia developed concurrently. The case is a 7-year-old boy. He is the youngest to suffer interstitial pneumonia due to Sho-saiko-to in Japan, showing the possibility that interstitial pneumonia occurs even in childhood. A study of the IgG subclass at the time of the development of interstitial pneumonia in the affected child showed an imbalance of the subclass, with an increase in the percentage of IgG1 and IgG3, and a decreased in the percentage of IgG2 and IgG4. With improvement in the symptoms thereafter, however, the IgG subclass normalized. Thus it is possible that the IgG subclass is concerned with the development of interstitial pneumonia in this case. So, making careful observations is needed in administering Sho saiko-to to children with type C hepatitis who use various immunosuppressants.

18472288|t|Herbal medicine Shakuyaku-kanzo-to reduces paclitaxel-induced painful peripheral neuropathy in mice.
18472288|a|OBJECTIVES: Paclitaxel is widely used in cancer chemotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors such as breast, ovarian and lung cancer. However, it sometimes induces moderate to severe muscle pain, and impairs the patients' quality of life. An appropriate method for relieving this pain is not well established. Shakuyaku-kanzo-to, a herbal medicine, is known to relieve menstrual pain, muscle spasm, and muscle pain, and its effectiveness is expected. To ascertain the effectiveness of Shakuyaku-kanzo-to on paclitaxel-induced pain, we investigated the effects of Shakuyaku-kanzo-to and its constituent herbal medicines in a mouse model. METHODS: Seven-week-old male ddY mice were used. To make a mouse model of paclitaxel-induced pain, different single, intraperitoneally injected doses of this drug were tested in various groups of mice, and the optimal dose was determined. To estimate the effects of Shakuyaku-kanzo-to, the constituent herbal medicines Shakuyaku and Kanzo, and loxoprofen sodium as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug on paclitaxel-induced pain, mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia of the hind paw were assessed. RESULTS: Paclitaxel administered at a dose of 10mg/kg or more produced allodynia and hyperalgesia; the time courses were similar to those of pain after paclitaxel administration in cancer patients. Shakuyaku-kanzo-to significantly relieved the allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by paclitaxel (10mg/kg). Shakuyaku and Kanzo inhibited the allodynia and hyperalgesia to some extent, but not significantly, while loxoprofen sodium was without effects. CONCLUSIONS: A single administration of paclitaxel (10mg/kg) produced allodynia and hyperalgesia in mice, suggesting that it could be used as an animal model resembling the painful conditions observed in humans medicated with this drug. Using this model, Shakuyaku-kanzo-to was shown to relieve paclitaxel-induced painful peripheral neuropathy.

33781876|t|Longdan Xiegan Tang attenuates liver injury and hepatic insulin resistance by regulating the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis-mediated anti-inflammatory pathway in rats.
33781876|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The ancient Chinese herbal formula Longdan Xiegan Tang (LXT, also called Gentiana Longdancao Decoction to Drain the Liver) treats insulin resistance- and inflammation-associated liver injuries in clinical practice. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying LXT-elicited improvement of the liver injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male rats were co-treated with olanzapine (5 mg/kg) and LXT extract (50 and 500 mg/kg) for eight weeks. Blood parameters were determined enzymatically or by ELISA. Gene/protein expression was analyzed by Real-Time PCR, Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: LXT attenuated olanzapine-induced liver injury manifested by hyperactivities of plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminostransferase, hyperbilirubinemia and hypoalbuminemia. Furthermore, LXT improved hepatic insulin resistance that was indicated by hyperinsulinemia, the increased HOMA-IR index, and hepatic over-phosphorylation of Ser(307) in insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1, Ser(731) in IRS2, Tyr(607) in phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85alpha and Ser(473) in AKT at baseline. Mechanistically, LXT inhibited olanzapine-triggered hepatic over-phosphorylation of both IkappaB kinase (IKK)alpha/beta and nuclear factor (NF)kappaB p65 proteins, and mRNA overexpression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, interleukin 1beta and CD68. More importantly, LXT restored the decreases in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein level, and its downstream targets Ang (1-7) content and Mas receptor expression. CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrate that LXT attenuates liver injury and hepatic insulin resistance by regulating the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis-mediated anti-inflammatory pathway in rats. Our findings provide a better understanding of LXT for treatment of insulin resistance- and inflammation-associated liver injuries.

22803378|t|[Metabonomic study on siwu tang in radiation-induced blood deficient mice].
22803378|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the radiation-induced blood deficiency and the combination of prescription and syndrome of Siwu Tang using ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupoles-time of flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS), in order to discover the changes in metabolic profiles of blood deficient mice induced by radiation, and clarify the relationship between blood deficient syndrome and the mechanism of Siwu Tang. METHOD: Thirty six C57 mice were randomly divided into three groups: the control group and the model model groups and the Siwu Tang group. The model was established by general irradiation with 3.5 Gy60 Coy ray. The animals were sacrificed on the 7th day after radiation and their blood, spleens and thymus were collected and detected using UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF/MS. MarkerLynx XS software was adopted to identify chromatographic peaks in the total ion chromatogram. Data was processed by making principal component analysis and analyzed by orthogonal partial least squares method among these groups, in order to rapidly identify marks through pattern recognition and analysis. RESULT: Compared with the control group, lysophosphatide, glucosiduronic acid, monoacylglycerol, erythronic acid, ceramide, aspartate phosphate ester, glyceryl phosphatide were obviously changed in the sera of the model group. Monoacylglycerol, ceramide, lysophosphatide, hydroxybutyric acid, palmitinic acid, 3-hydroxystearic acid, diethylarginine, neuraminic acid, phosphatidylserine were found in metabolites of their spleens. Methyladenosine, sitosterol, carnitine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, diglyceride, dimethylarginine, ceramide, hydroxybutyric acid, cholesterol were found in thymus of the model group. CONCLUSION: Analysis on physiological functions of these biological markers show that radiation could induce the disorder of the metabolism of lipoid and carbohydrate and affect the synthesis of some amino acids, and Siwu Tang can reverse these effects.

32505839|t|A traditional Chinese medicine formula inhibits tumor growth in mice and regulates the miR-34b/c-Met/beta-catenin pathway.
32505839|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: Si-Jun-Zi-Tang (SJZT) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula used to treat chronic and debilitating diseases including melanoma. SJZT-based therapies have achieved good clinical outcomes in melanoma management. However, the pharmacological basis of SJZT for its clinical use in melanoma treatment is not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the anti-melanoma effects and mechanism of action of an ethanolic extract of SJZT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SJZT was extracted using 50% ethanol. A murine B16 melanoma-bearing mouse model was employed to investigate the anti-melanoma effects of SJZT. microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA levels were examined by RT-qPCR, and protein levels were measured by Western blotting. RESULTS: SJZT significantly inhibited B16 tumor growth in mice. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SJZT elevated miR-34b (a tumor suppressing miRNA), and lowered c-Met (a miR-34b target gene) and beta-catenin (a downstream molecule of c-Met signaling) expression levels in the B16 tumors. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found, for the first time, that SJZT exerts anti-melanoma effects and regulates the miR-34b/c-Met/beta-catenin pathway in a melanoma mouse model. Our findings provide pharmacological justifications for the clinical use of SJZT in treating melanoma.

22927877|t|The chinese herbal decoction danggui buxue tang inhibits angiogenesis in a rat model of liver fibrosis.
22927877|a|In this study, we investigated the anti-angiogenic effect of the Chinese herbal decoction Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT; Radix Astragali and Radix Angelicae sinensis in 5 : 1 ratio) in a rat model of liver fibrosis, in order to elucidate its mechanisms of action against liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis was induced with CCl(4) and high-fat food for 6 weeks, and the rats were treated with oral doses of DBT (6 g raw herbs/kg/d) and N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC; 0.1 g/kg/d). The results showed that both DBT and NAC attenuated liver fibrosis and neo-angiogenesis. Furthermore, DBT and NAC improved SOD activity but decreased MDA content and 8-OH-dG in fibrotic livers, with DBT being more effective than NAC. DBT decreased the expression of VEGF, Ang1 and TGF-beta1 and their signaling mediators, whereas NAC had no effect on VEGF and VEGFR2 expression. Both DBT and NAC reduced HIF-1alpha gene and protein expression in fibrotic livers, with DBT being more effective. These data clearly demonstrate that the anti-fibrotic properties of DBT are related to its ability to inhibit angiogenesis and its anti-angiogenic mechanisms are associated with improving oxidative stress, regulating the expression and signaling of angiogenic factors, and especially modulating HIF-1alpha in fibrotic livers.

33645072|a|This paper was to investigate the effect of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction(HLJD) on ulcerative colitis(UC) in mice, and determine the effective components in plasma, and virtually screen its therapeutic target, and predict its mechanism. Sixty Balb/c mice were randomly divided into blank group, model group, mesalazine treatment group(0.3 g.kg~(-1)), and HLJD treatment groups(24.66, 12.33, 6.17 g.kg~(-1)). Excepted for the blank group, all the mice in HLJD and mesalazine treatment groups were gavage administration. All mice freely drank 2.5% DSS solution for seven days to induce UC. The disease activity index(DAI) was detected each day. At the end of the experiment, HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes in colon. The content of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in colon were determined by ELISA. The effective components in plasma were determined by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. The reverse docking in PharmMapper was used to screen the component targets. The disease targets of UC were collected by searching TTD, OMIM and GeneCards databases. The intersection of the component targets and disease targets was selected as the therapeutic targets. Then the therapeutic targets were imported into the STRING for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Discovery Studio was used to simulate the docking between the components and the targets. RESULTS:: showed that the DAI in the model group increased significantly(P<0.05), and the number of inflammatory cells and infiltration degree increased significantly compared with the blank group. The DAI in HLJD treatment group was significantly reduced(P<0.05), and the number and infiltration degree of inflammatory cells were reduced compared with the model group. The ELISA results showed that the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were increased significantly in the model group(P<0.01) compared with the blank group, and significantly down regulated in the HLJD treatment group(P<0.05) compared with the model group. After UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analyse, ten components were identified. The network pharmacology analysis showed that the action targets were significantly enriched in 129 of biological processes, such as response to organic substance, chemical and oxygen-containing compound, etc., as well as 16 of signal pathways, such as IL-17, TNF and hepatitis B signal pathways, were enriched too. The results of molecular docking showed that limonin, palmatine and berberine could bind to CASP3 and MMP9 by hydrogen bond. In conclusion, HLJD could alleviate the colonic mucosal inflammatory infiltration and mucosal damage in UC mice. The mechanism may be related to the anti-inflammatory effect on UC mice by reducing the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in colon through limonin, palmatine and berberine regulating IL-17 signal pathway and TNF signal pathway via CASP3 and MMP9 meditated.

26851631|t|Zhen-wu-tang attenuates cationic bovine serum albumin-induced inflammatory response in membranous glomerulonephritis rat through inhibiting AGEs/RAGE/NF-kappaB pathway activation.
26851631|a|Zhen-wu-tang (ZWT), a traditional Chinese compound formula recorded in the Treatise on Febrile Diseases, has significant inhibitory effects on inflammatory damage and oxidative lesions in rats, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to explore whether the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of ZWT were mediated by the AGEs/RAGE/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in rats with cationic bovine serum albumin (C-BSA)-induced membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). We found that ZWT significantly reduced the production of malondialdehyde (MDA), but enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The ELISA results showed that ZWT not only reduced the serum levels of AGEs but also decreased the release of inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6). Meanwhile, HE staining showed that pathological kidney injury was alleviated by ZWT. In addition, ZWT suppressed the expression of RAGE1 and NF-kappaB p65, as well as the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65. The accumulation of AGEs, oxidative lesions and inflammation damage were reduced by an AGE inhibitor. Thus, the present study demonstrates that AGEs play a role in the pathogenesis of MGN and that AGE inhibition could reduce the inflammatory reactions and oxidative lesions in MGN. In general, ZWT attenuated MGN, in part, by inhibiting the AGEs/RAGE/NF-kappaB pathway.

33680065|t|Efficacy of Longdan Xiegan Decoction on the Treatment of Eczema: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
33680065|a|BACKGROUND: Longdan Xiegan decoction (LDXGD) has been widely used in the treatment of eczema. In recent years, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of LDXGD for the treatment of eczema have gradually increased. Most of the results show that LDXGD is effective in treating eczema. However, whether these conclusions are reliable or not requires meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the clinical efficacy of LDXGD in the treatment of eczema. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven electronic databases, including PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Literature on Disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, and Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) were systematically searched from their inception until January 2021. Risk of bias was assessed using criteria from the Cochrane Collaboration and meta-analysis was conducted on the screened literature data using Review Manage (RevMan 5.3). Then, to assess the quality of evidence, the GRADE criteria was adopted. RESULTS: 14 RCTs with 1080 participants were identified. Meta-analysis indicated that compared with western medicine (WM), the cure rate and the total effective rate of LDXGD in treating eczema were higher. Meanwhile, the recurrence rate and the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) after treatment were lower. The adverse reaction was reported in 5 out of 14 studies without significant statistical difference. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was low for all outcomes except for the cure rate (moderate-quality evidence) and the total effective rate (moderate-quality evidence). CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy of LDXGD in the treatment of eczema was more effective compared with the one of conventional WM alone. However, due to the limitation of the quality of the included studies, additional studies are required to further confirm these results.

24517068|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Banxia Xiexin Decoction (BXD) on expression of the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and stem cell factor (SCF) in the antrum of rats with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: Totally sixty healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into the control group, the model group, the BXD group, and the Western medicine group (WM, treated by domperidone), 15 in each group. Diabetic rat models were established by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg). Those in the BXD group were perfused with BXD at the daily dose of 5.4 g/kg. An equal volume of distilled water was given by gastrogavage to those in the WM group and the control group for 8 successive weeks. The body weight and blood glucose of all rats were detected, and the gastric residual rates were detected with semisolid nutrient paste by gastrogavage. The expression of positive ICCs and SCF were observed by immunohistochemical method and quantified image analyzer. RESULTS: Compared with the control group,the body weight reduced, blood glucose and gastric residual rates increased, and the mean optical density of positive ICCs and SCF significantly decreased in the model group (P < 0.05). Compared with the model group,symptoms such as polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria were relieved, spirits improved, the body weight and mean optical densities of positive ICCs and SCF significantly increased (P < 0.05), and gastric residual rates significantly decreased in the BXD group and the WM group (P < 0.05). The blood glucose significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the BXD group. The mean optical density of positive ICCs was higher in the BXD group than in the WM group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: BXD could promote the expression of positive ICCs and SCF. It could improve the gastric motility in DM rats by partially inverting abnormal changes of gastric antral ICCs and SCF.

18706097|t|Kihi-to, a herbal traditional medicine, improves Abeta(25-35)-induced memory impairment and losses of neurites and synapses.
18706097|a|BACKGROUND: We previously hypothesized that achievement of recovery of brain function after the injury requires the reconstruction of neuronal networks, including neurite regeneration and synapse reformation. Kihi-to is composed of twelve crude drugs, some of which have already been shown to possess neurite extension properties in our previous studies. The effect of Kihi-to on memory deficit has not been examined. Thus, the goal of the present study is to determine the in vivo and in vitro effects of Kihi-to on memory, neurite growth and synapse reconstruction. METHODS: Effects of Kihi-to, a traditional Japanese-Chinese traditional medicine, on memory deficits and losses of neurites and synapses were examined using Alzheimer's disease model mice. Improvements of Abeta(25-35)-induced neuritic atrophy by Kihi-to and the mechanism were investigated in cultured cortical neurons. RESULTS: Administration of Kihi-to for consecutive 3 days resulted in marked improvements of Abeta(25-35)-induced impairments in memory acquisition, memory retention, and object recognition memory in mice. Immunohistochemical comparisons suggested that Kihi-to attenuated neuritic, synaptic and myelin losses in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Kihi-to also attenuated the calpain increase in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. When Kihi-to was added to cells 4 days after Abeta(25-35) treatment, axonal and dendritic outgrowths in cultured cortical neurons were restored as demonstrated by extended lengths of phosphorylated neurofilament-H (P-NF-H) and microtubule-associated protein (MAP)2-positive neurites. Abeta(25-35)-induced cell death in cortical culture was also markedly inhibited by Kihi-to. Since NF-H, MAP2 and myelin basic protein (MBP) are substrates of calpain, and calpain is known to be involved in Abeta-induced axonal atrophy, expression levels of calpain and calpastatin were measured. Treatment with Kihi-to inhibited the Abeta(25-35)-evoked increase in the calpain level and decrease in the calpastatin level. In addition, Kihi-to inhibited Abeta(25-35)-induced calcium entry. CONCLUSION: In conclusion Kihi-to clearly improved the memory impairment and losses of neurites and synapses.

29867485|t|An Herbal Drug, Gongjin-dan, Ameliorates Acute Fatigue Caused by Short-Term Sleep-Deprivation: A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Clinical Trial.
29867485|a|Introduction:Gongjin-dan (GJD) is an herbal drug commonly used in Korea and China to combat fatigue, but there are only few clinical studies on its effectiveness and experimental studies on its mechanism of action, and no randomized controlled trial of GJD on the efficacy and mechanism of action has been reported. Here, we performed an exploratory study to evaluate both questions regarding GJD use in humans. Methods: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial was conducted in the Republic of Korea. Healthy male participants were recruited and randomly allocated to groups receiving GJD-placebo or placebo-GJD in sequence. Fatigue was artificially induced by sleep deprivation for 2 nights. The primary outcome was a change in serum cortisol level; levels of biomarkers for stress hormones as well as oxidative stress and immunologic factors were also assessed, and questionnaires on fatigue and sleep quality were conducted. Results: Twelve and 11 participants were assigned to the GJD-placebo and placebo-GJD groups, respectively. Of all 23 participants, depending on crossover design, we analyzed a total of 20 participants for GJD, and 21 for placebo. An increase in serum cortisol appeared to be attenuated by GJD administration (p = 0.25), but the effect was not statistically significant; a similar pattern was observed in salivary cortisol levels (p = 0.14). Overall, GJD showed a tendency to reduce fatigue according to the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI, p = 0.07) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS, p = 0.13) questionnaires. BFI and FSS scores in the first stage (before the crossover), however, were significantly improved (BFI, p = 0.02; FSS, p = 0.05) after GJD treatment (relative to placebo). GJD also seemed to improve sleep quality as assessed by the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (p = 0.06), with a significant improvement specifically in the condition "Getting To Sleep" (p = 0.02). Five participants experienced minor adverse events, but no adverse events were specific to the GJD administration period. Conclusions: This trial produced the first clinical evidence that GJD might have anti-fatigue properties, especially under sleep deprivation; however, the investigation of cortisol-mediated mechanisms requires further larger-scale studies in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform KCT0001681 (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=KCT0001681).

30302776|a|Monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids are the main bioactive components of Sini decoction, which is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine formula for the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure in China. In this work, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with microdialysis method was successfully established and applied for investigating for the first time comparative plasma pharmacokinetics of three monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids (benzoylmesaconitine, benzoylaconitine and benzoylhypacoitine) in normal and MI rats after oral administration of Sini decoction. The statistical results of pharmacokinetic parameters demonstrated that benzoylmesaconitine, benzoylaconitine and benzoylhypacoitine showed lower peak concentration, longer half-life, smaller area under the concentration-time curve, slower clearance, time to peak concentration and mean residence time in MI rats than in normal rats (p < 0.05), which indicated that monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids exhibited lower systemic exposure and slower elimination in the MI rats. The results provided the experimental basis for understanding the metabolic fate and therapeutic effects of Sini decoction.

27803787|t|Anti-inflammatory effect of Yu-Ping-Feng-San via TGF-beta1 signaling suppression in rat model of COPD.
27803787|a|OBJECTIVES: Yu-Ping-Feng-San (YPFS) is a classical traditional Chinese medicine that is widely used for treatment of the diseases in respiratory systems, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) recognized as chronic inflammatory disease. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we detected the factors involved in transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1)/Smad2 signaling pathway and inflammatory cytokines, to clarify whether YPFS could attenuate inflammatory response dependent on TGF-beta1/Smad2 signaling in COPD rats or cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated human bronchial epithelial (Beas-2B) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The COPD rat model was established by exposure to cigarette smoke and intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide, YPFS was administered to the animals. The efficacy of YPFS was evaluated by comparing the severity of pulmonary pathological damage, pro-inflammation cytokines, collagen related genes and the activation of TGF-beta1/Smad2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, CSE-treated cells were employed to confirm whether the effect of YPFS was dependent on the TGF-beta1/Smad2 signaling via knockdown Smad2 (Si-RNA), or pretreatment with the inhibitor of TGF-beta1. RESULTS: Administration of YPFS effectively alleviated injury of lung, suppressed releasing of pro-inflammatory cytokines and collagen deposition in COPD animals (P<0.05), whereas exogenous TGF-beta1 promoted releasing of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha (P<0.05). Administration YPFS reduced inflammatory response significantly, also down-regulated TGF-beta1/Smad2 signaling in vivo and in vitro. Unexpectedly, knockdown Smad2 or inhibition of TGF-beta1 abolished anti-inflammatory effect of YPFS in CSE-treated cells. CONCLUSION: YPFS accomplished anti-inflammatory effects mainly by suppressing phosphorylation of Smad2, TGF-beta1/Smad2 signaling pathway was required for YPFS-mediated anti-inflammation in COPD rats or CSE-treated Beas-2B cells.

27882217|t|Multiple effects of Xihuang pill aqueous extract on the Hs578T triple-negative breast cancer cell line.
27882217|a|The management of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is challenging due to the aggressive behavior, lack of therapeutic options and relatively poor prognosis. Xihuang pill (XHP) is a well-known Traditional Chinese Medicine with anticancer activity. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the aqueous extract of XHP (AEXHP) has anti-proliferative activity against the Hs578T TNBC cell line, and to elucidate its molecular mechanisms of action. First, an MTT assay was used to evaluate the anti-proliferative activity of AEXHP on the Hs578T cell line; furthermore, the cell cycle distribution, mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic rate were determined by flow cytometry, and western blot analysis was used to assess the expression of apoptosis and cell cycle regulatory proteins to investigate the mechanisms of action. The results revealed that the cell viability was significantly inhibited by AEXHP in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential loss were detected, and after treatment with 4, 8 and 12 mg/ml AEXHP for 24 h, cleaved caspase-3 was 1.70-, 1.81- and 1.84-fold of that of the control, while procaspase-3, procaspase-8, cleaved caspase-8, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio were not significantly affected. Cell cycle analysis revealed that treatment with AEXHP led to S-phase arrest of Hs578T cells. Furthermore, AEXHP treatment resulted in decreased expression of cyclin A and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), and increased expression of cyclin E and p21(Cip1), as compared to the control group. In conclusion, the viability of Hs578T cells was significantly inhibited by AEXHP in a dose- and time-dependent manner, the likely mechanisms of which being induction of apoptosis, probably via the intrinsic, Bcl-2-independent pathway, and cell cycle arrest in S phase due to decreased expression of cyclin A and CDK2, and increased expression of cyclin E and p21(Cip1).

2585824|t|[The effects of sairei-to on nephrotoxic serum nephritis in rats--possible effects on intraglomerular cell mediated immunity].
2585824|a|Sairei-to, one of the herb drugs, has been demonstrated to have several effects. Clinically, evidence have been accumulated showing that sairei-to has been able to reduce the frequency of relapse in minimal change nephrotic syndrome. It has also found that sairei-to has improved proteinurial in minimal change nephrotic syndrome as well as chronic glomerulonephritis in man. Although the mechanism of such effects is still unclear, it is supposed that its immune modulating actions that has been reported. In this study, we quantitated the number of intrarenal Ia positive cells and T cells in nephrotoxic nephritis in rats in order to clarify the intrarenal immune actions of sairei-to on immune mediated glomerulonephritis. Four groups of rats with nephrotoxic nephritis were experimented on. The first group was the controlled group, had no treatment whatsoever. The second group was administered with MPSL (solu-medrol 20 mg/kg, alternate day). The fourth group with both sairei-to and MPSL. The level of proteinuria in three groups treated was almost the same, that is, less than that of controlled group. On light microscopy, sairei-to suppressed glomerular inflammation such as endocapillary proliferative lesions and mesangial expansion, which were shown in controlled group. The histological improvement was almost the found in rats treated with MPSL and both. Sairei-to suppressed infiltrations of intraglomerular Ia positive cells (P less than 0.01) and T cells (P less than 0.01) on the 7th day and 14th day as well. Remarkable suppression of T cells infiltration was noted in rats treated with MPSL along with sairei-to on the 14th day (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

34610419|t|Integrated lipidomics, transcriptomics and network pharmacology analysis to reveal the mechanisms of Danggui Buxue Decoction in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
34610419|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Danggui Buxue Decoction (DBT) is classical prescriptions, which contains two Traditional Chinese Medicines of Angelicae sinensis radix and Astragali radix. According to the preliminary work of our laboratory and numerous studies, it has been found that DBT has a therapeutic effect on diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, the mechanisms underlying its action remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of DBT on kidney disease in diabetic mice and further explore its protective mechanism. METHODS: DN mice model was induced by high-fat fodder and streptozotocin (STZ). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of 6 compounds in DBT was carried out by HPLC, including calycosin-7-glucoside, ferulic acid, ononin, calycosin, formononetin, and levostilide A. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining was used to determine the degree of kidney pathological damage. The UPLC-Q Exactive MS technique was used to analyze the lipids metabolism profile of kidneys samples and multiple statistical analysis methods were used to screen and identify biomarkers. Transcriptomics analyses were carried out using RNAseq. The possible molecular mechanism was unraveled by network pharmacology. RESULTS: Thirty-one significantly altered lipid metabolites were identified in the model group comparing with the control group. DBT improved aberrant expression of several pathways related to lipidomics, including glycerophospholipid metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism. Comprehensive analysis indicated that DBT intervention reduced the content of Cers, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylcholines in mouse kidneys by downregulating the transcription level of Degs2 and Cers, reducing lipid accumulation and promoting Akt phosphorylation by upregulating the expression of Acers and Pdk1. Network pharmacology analysis showed that components in DBT, such as kaempferol, ferulic acid and astragaloside IV, could be responsible for the pharmacological activity of DN by regulating the AGE-RAGE, PI3K/Akt, MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in diabetic complications. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that DBT may improve DN by affecting insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and lipid accumulation.

31217803|t|Kihito, a Traditional Japanese Kampo Medicine, Improves Cognitive Function in Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
31217803|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We previously reported that the administration of traditional Japanese medicines, kihito (Gui-Pi-Tang in Chinese) and kamikihito (Jia-Wei-Gui-Pi-Tang in Chinese), to Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice improved memory impairment. There are a few reports that show kihito and kamikihito have a beneficial effect on the cognitive function of AD patients in clinical studies. However, these studies are not comparative and are retrospective studies; thus, more evidence is needed. Therefore, we conducted an open-label, crossover designed clinical trial to investigate the effect of kihito on cognitive function of AD patients. METHODS: The inclusion criteria for eligible patients were as follows: (1) imaging diagnosis (magnetic resonance imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography) of AD, (2) a treatment regimen including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), and (3) a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score >/=15. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) change in ChEI dosage, (2) memantine usage, and (3) MMSE score < 15. To prevent bias in age and baseline cognitive function, patients were divided into two groups: the first group received 2.5 g of kihito extract 3 times/day during the first half of the study (weeks 0-16) and the second group received the same dose of kihito during the second half of the study (weeks 17-32). ChEI dosage did not change during the study period. Patients underwent a cognitive function test during weeks 0, 16, and 32. Cognitive function was evaluated by Japanese versions of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-J) and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS-J) test. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the clinical trial (4 males, 6 females, average age 71.7 years). MMSE-J scores significantly increased during the kihito intake period. RBANS-J test scores had a slight improvement during the kihito intake period compared with the ChEI alone treatment period, but no significant changes were observed. CONCLUSION: Kihito improves cognitive function in AD patients.

35341010|t|Liuwei Dihuang Pill Attenuates Diabetic Nephropathy by Inhibiting Renal Fibrosis via TGF-beta/Smad2/3 Pathway.
35341010|a|Among all the complications of diabetes, diabetic nephropathy is a significant factor causing the end-stage renal disease associated with high death rates. Current treatment fails to produce an ideal outcome. Thus, searching for a new preventive drug is urgently needed. Liuwei Dihuang pill (LDP), a popular ancient Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription, has been applied to treat DN-like syndromes according to TCM theory. Here, we had established an animal model with DN and LDP therapy was put into use to assess its therapeutic effect in vivo. Our data showed that oxidative stress and TGF-beta/Smad2/3 pathway-induced renal fibrosis could be observed in the DN animal model. However, the treatment of LDP impeded the generation of ROS and attenuated renal fibrosis-related proteins in damaged kidneys through interference in the TGF-beta/Smad3 pathway. Our results indicated that LDP attenuated oxidative stress, accompanied by preventing the production of renal fibrosis through inhibiting the TGF-beta/Smad2/3 pathway.

26802785|t|The effects of Tao-Hong-Si-Wu on hepatic necroinflammatory activity and fibrosis in a murine model of chronic liver disease.
26802785|a|BACKGROUND: Tao-Hong-Si-Wu decoction (THSWD) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has been used for centuries in the treatment of Chinese patients with chronic liver disease. Recently, THSWD has been reported to alter vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced angiogenesis, raising the possibility that in addition to its anti-inflammatory properties; THSWD might also inhibit hepatic blood flow associated fibrosis. AIM: To document the effects of THSWD on hepatic necroinflammatory disease activity, fibrosis and VEGF signaling in a murine model of chronic liver disease. METHODS: Sixty adult mice were equally divided into six study groups. Five groups were exposed to subcutaneous carbon tetrachloride (0.1 ml/10 g BW) for six weeks. Three of the five groups were treated with different concentrations of THSWD (4.25, 8.50, 17.00 g/kg), one with 0.1mg/kg of Colchicine (positive control), and one with physiologic saline (negative control). Mice in the sixth group were not exposed to CCl4 and remained untreated (healthy controls). Liver enzymes/function tests, hyaluronic acid and laminin levels were measured in serum, and hepatic histology, VEGF, Flt-1 and kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR), Akt and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) expression were documented in liver tissue at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Hepatic necroinflammatory disease activity and fibrosis were significantly attenuated in THSWD treated mice in a dose dependent manner. These beneficial results were similar and often exceeded those achieved with Colchicine. In addition, VEGF, Flt-1, KDR, Akt and pAkt mRNA and protein expression were reduced in TSHWD treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: In this animal model of chronic liver disease, THSWD decreased hepatic necroinflammatory disease and fibrosis. Inhibition of VEGF expression and downstream signaling were associated with these findings. Further studies with this and other TCMs as treatment for chronic liver disease are warranted.

23195240|t|Choto-san in the treatment of vascular dementia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
23195240|a|In an earlier placebo-controlled study, we demonstrated that a kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine called Choto-san (Diao-Teng-San in Chinese) was effective in treating vascular dementia. To evaluate its efficacy using more objective criteria, we carried out a multi-center, double-blind study of Choto-san extract (7.5 g/day) and a placebo, each given three times a day for 12 weeks to patients suffering from this condition. The study enrolled and analyzed 139 patients, 50 males and 89 females, with a mean age of 76.6 years. Choto-san was statistically superior to the placebo in global improvement rating, utility rating, global improvement rating of subjective symptoms, global improvement rating of psychiatric symptoms and global improvement rating of disturbance in daily living activities. Such items as spontaneity of conversation, lack of facial expression, decline in simple mathematical ability, global intellectual ability, nocturnal delirium, sleep disturbance, hallucination or delusion, and putting on and taking off clothes were significantly improved at one or more evaluation points in those taking Choto-san compared to those taking the placebo. Furthermore, the change in revised version of Hasegawa's dementia scale from the beginning point in Choto-san group was tended to be higher than that in placebo group with no statistical significance. These results suggest that Choto-san is effective in the treatment of vascular dementia.

34545290|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Wenjing Decoction and Tiaobu Chongren acupuncture and moxibustion therapy on serum sex hormones and ovarian function recovery in premature ovarian failure (POF) patients with deficiency-cold syndrome. METHODS: From February 2018 to October 2019, 119 POI patients with deficiency-cold syndrome who met the selection criteria were randomly divided into the control group (n = 59) and the observation group (n = 60). The control group was treated with hormone replacement therapy, and the observation group was treated with Wenjing Decoction and Tiaobu Chongren acupuncture and moxibustion therapy on the basis of the control group. Both groups were treated continuously for 3 months. After treatment, the clinical efficacy of the two groups was compared, the Chinese medicine syndrome score, serum estradiol (E 2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and bilateral antral follicle count (AFC), mean ovarian volume, and endometrial thickness of the two groups before and after treatment were compared. RESULT: The effective rate of the observation group (93.10%) was higher than that of the control group (77.59%) (P < 0.05). After treatment, the index scores of traditional Chinese medicine syndromes in two groups were lower than before (P < 0.05), and the observation group was lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The serum E 2 and AMH levels in the two groups increased, while FSH and LH levels decreased compared with before treatment, and the observation group improved significantly compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The bilateral AFC, mean ovarian volume, and endometrial thickness of the two groups increased compared with before treatment, and the observation group was higher than the control group (P < 0.05).

29218037|t|Wuji Wan Formula Ameliorates Diarrhea and Disordered Colonic Motility in Post-inflammation Irritable Bowel Syndrome Rats by Modulating the Gut Microbiota.
29218037|a|Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota contribute to the treatment of post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS). Our previous studies have demonstrated that a Chinese formula, Wuji Wan, has the ability to mitigate abdominal pain and diarrhea in PI-IBS rats. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism and whether the gut microbiota mediate the effect of Wuji Wan on PI-IBS. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether Wuji Wan mitigated PI-IBS by modifying the gut microbiota. PI-IBS was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by enema using 4% acetic acid and restraint stress. Rats were fed water, Wuji Wan extract (630 mg/kg) or pinaverium bromide (13.5 mg/kg). Our data showed that Wuji Wan effectively ameliorated abdominal pain, colonic motility abnormality and visceral hypersensitivity. Analysis of the fecal microbiota showed that Wuji Wan could reverse the reduction in richness of the gut microbiota and significantly increase the relative abundances of Akkermansia, Bacteroides, and Parasutterella; however, Lactobacillus and Prevotella were markedly decreased in the PI-IBS rats. Moreover, Wuji Wan promoted goblet cell proliferation in the colonic mucosa by increasing the release of mucin, up-regulating the distribution of tight junction proteins Occludin and ZO-1 and down-regulating the expression of MLCK in colonic epithelial cells. These findings suggest that Wuji Wan may remit IBS by modulating the gut microbiota and stabilizing the gut mucosal barrier, indicating that the use of a classical formula of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that exhibits a prebiotic effect may be a promising strategy for PI-IBS treatment.

8982434|t|Protective and therapeutic effects of huanglian-jie-du-tang on hepatotoxin-induced liver injuries.
8982434|a|The hepatoprotective effect of Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT), a Chinese medicinal prescription, was investigated in three kinds of experimental models. The animals were treated with HLJDT (300 mg/kg, p.o.) thrice at 2, 4 and 10 hours after administration with carbon tetrachloride (32 microliters/kg, i.p.), acetaminophen (600 mg/kg, i.p.) and beta-D-galactosamine (188 mg/kg, i.p.). Significant hepatoprotective effects on carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen induced liver injuries were noted, but no significant effect on beta-D-galactosamine induced liver injury was observed. These hepatoprotective effects were evidenced by comparing the serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) levels in HLJDT treated and untreated groups. Serum enzyme activities in the carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen experiments were significantly lower in the treated groups while the herbal prescription has no effect on the beta-D-galactosamine experiment. These results demonstrated that Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang has a hepatoprotective effect against experimental liver injuries induced by specific hepatotoxins, and therefore may be useful in treating some, but not all, liver injuries.

33747100|t|A Network Pharmacology-Based Approach to Investigating the Mechanisms of Fushen Granule Effects on Intestinal Barrier Injury in Chronic Renal Failure.
33747100|a|PURPOSE: Fushen Granule (FSG) is a Chinese medicine prepared by doctors for treating patients with chronic renal failure, which is usually accompanied by gastrointestinal dysfunction. Here, we explore the protective effect of FSG on intestinal barrier injury in chronic renal failure through bioinformatic analysis and experimental verification. METHODS: In this study, information on the components and targets of FSG related to CRF is collected to construct and visualize protein-protein interaction networks and drug-compound-target networks using network pharmacological methods. DAVID is used to conduct gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Then, it is validated by in vitro experiments. In this study, the human intestinal epithelial (T84) cells are used and divided into four groups: control group, model group, FSG low-dose group, and FSG high-dose group. After the experiment, the activity of T84 cells is detected by a MTT assay, and the expressions of tight junction protein ZO-1, claudin-1, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), malondialdehyde (MDA), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are examined by immunofluorescence and/or western blotting. RESULTS: Eighty-six potential chronic renal failure-related targets are identified by FSG; among them, nine core genes are screened. Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis shows that the cancer-related signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the HIF1 signaling pathway, and the TNF signaling pathway may play key roles in the treatment of CRF by FSG. The MTT method showed that FSG is not cytotoxic to uremic toxin-induced injured T84 cells. The results of immunofluorescence and WB indicate that compared with the control group, protein expressions level of ZO-1, claudin-1, and Nrf2 in T84 cells is decreased and protein expressions level of HO-1, MDA, and COX-2 is increased after urinary toxin treatment. Instead, compared with the model group, protein expressions level of ZO-1, claudin-1, and Nrf2 in T84 cells is increased and protein expressions level of HO-1, MDA, and COX-2 is decreased after FSG treatment. CONCLUSION: FSG had a protective effect on urinary toxin-induced intestinal epithelial barrier injury in chronic renal failure, and its mechanism may be related to the upregulation of Nrf2/HO-1 signal transduction and the inhibition of tissue oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Screening CRF targets and identifying the corresponding FSG components by network pharmacological methods is a practical strategy to explain the mechanism of FSG in improving gastrointestinal dysfunction in CRF.
33747100|k|CONCLUSION: FSG had a protective effect on urinary toxin-induced intestinal epithelial barrier injury in chronic renal failure, and its mechanism may be related to the upregulation of Nrf2/HO-1 signal transduction and the inhibition of tissue oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.

32259664|t|Tianma Gouteng granules decreases the susceptibility of Parkinson's disease by inhibiting ALOX15-mediated lipid peroxidation.
32259664|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tianma Gouteng granules (TG), a clinical prescription of traditional Chinese medicine, has been clinically applied to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) in combination with Madopar, as included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015). TG has the potential to decrease the susceptibility of PD pharmacologically, however the mechanisms need detailed demonstration. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the pharmacological activities, as well as the possible mechanism of TG in diverse models of PD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 6-OHDA-treated rats, MPTP-treated mice, and alpha-synuclein A53T overexpressed mice, were utilized as PD animal models. Rotarod, locomotor activity, inclined plane and traction tests were used for behavioral assessment. Immunohistochemistry was used for tyrosine hydrolase determination. Western blot were conducted for detection of 4-HNE and 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15). The interactions of ALOX15 with the components in TG were predicted by molecular docking approach. RESULTS: Lipid peroxidation was involved in dopaminergic neuron damage in 6-OHDA-induced rat models. In MPTP-treated mice, the inhibition of lipid peroxidation improved behavioral and pathological symptoms of PD. The lipid peroxidation-related protein, ALOX15 was found to be the key factor in PD process in diverse PD models including 6-OHDA-treated rats, MPTP-treated mice, and alpha-synuclein A53T overexpressed mice. TG treatment significantly relieved behavioral and pathological symptoms of MPTP-induced PD mouse models with a potential mechanism of alleviating ALOX15-induced lipid peroxidation. Moreover, the results of molecular docking analysis show that compounds in TG might have interactions with ALOX15. CONCLUSIONS: TG effectively improved the behavioral and dopaminergic neuron damage in diverse PD models. The mechanism of this action may be related to the direct inhibition of ALOX15 and the relief of lipid peroxidation.

15626742|t|Baicalein, a component of Scutellaria radix from Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT), leads to suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in human myeloma cells.
15626742|a|In the search for a more effective adjuvant therapy to treat multiple myeloma (MM), we investigated the effects of the traditional Chinese herbal medicines Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT), Gui-Zhi-Fu-Ling-Wan (GZFLW), and Huang-Lian-Tang (HLT) on the proliferation and apoptosis of myeloma cells. HLJDT inhibited the proliferation of myeloma cell lines and the survival of primary myeloma cells, especially MPC-1- immature myeloma cells, and induced apoptosis in myeloma cell lines via a mitochondria-mediated pathway by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential and activating caspase-9 and caspase-3. Further experiments confirmed that Scutellaria radix was responsible for the suppressive effect of HLJDT on myeloma cell proliferation, and the baicalein in Scutellaria radix showed strong growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in comparison with baicalin or wogonin. Baicalein as well as baicalin suppressed the survival in vitro of MPC-1- immature myeloma cells rather than MPC-1+ myeloma cells from myeloma patients. Baicalein inhibited the phosphorylation of IkB-alpha, which was followed by decreased expression of the IL-6 and XIAP genes and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Therefore, HLJDT and Scutellaria radix have an antiproliferative effect on myeloma cells, especially MPC-1- immature myeloma cells, and baicalein may be responsible for the suppressive effect of Scutellaria radix by blocking IkB-alpha degradation.

28197938|t|Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Bathing with Chinese Medicine Taohong Siwu Decoction () for Treatment of Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.
28197938|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety of bathing therapy with Taohong Siwu Decoction (, TSD) in the treatment of early-stage, mild-moderate diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc). METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 148 men and women (18-60 years) with dcSSc (disease duration 12 months) and baseline modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS) 10. Patients were randomized into a TSD group (71 cases bathing with TSD plus oral prednisone) or control group (71 cases bathing with placebo plus oral prednisone). Bathing (40 degrees C, 30 min) of the upper and lower limbs was carried out once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome measure was MRSS; secondary outcomes were Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) score, quality of life (QOL), physician visual analogue scale (VAS), patient VAS, percent predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level and overall treatment effect. RESULTS: The final analysis included 135 patients (control group, 68 cases; TSD group, 67 cases). Primary and secondary outcome measures after 2 weeks of treatment showed no improvement (versus baseline) in both groups, with no differences between groups. At 12 weeks, QOL, physician VAS, patient VAS, ESR and CRP were improved in both groups, but MRSS and RP score were improved only in the TSD group (all P<0.05). MRSS, RP score, QOL, physician VAS, patient VAS, ESR and CRP differed significantly between groups (all P<0.05). Meanwhile, the overall treatment effect was significantly higher in the TSD group than in the control group (P<0.05). Adverse events in the two groups were similar (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bathing with TSD plus oral prednisone achieves better outcomes than oral prednisone alone in patients with dcSSc and is not associated with serious adverse events.

CD4(+) T cells and monocytes are two key parameters in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study investigated the changes in these cells in QLY-treated RA animal models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RA models were induced in male SD rats and were orally treated with QLY. Dynamic metabolic changes in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats were monitored by (1)H NMR approach. The immunity profiles of CIA and adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats were evaluated using immunohistochemical, PCR, ELISA, cytokine chip, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence experiments. The bioactive components in QLY were identified by bioinformatic-guided LC-MS analyses. The compounds with high abundance in QLY decoction and easily absorbed were taken as key anti-rheumatic components and used to treat blood-derived immune cells using in vitro experiments. RESULTS: The results indicated that QLY decreased Th17 cells frequency and T cells-released IL-6, IL-17 and GM-CSF in CIA rats, which was attributed to the impaired lymphocyte maturation and altered differentiation. QLY inhibited lactic acid production and inflammatory polarization in the monocytes during the peak period of AIA and CIA. AIA monocytes elicited significant increase in Th17 cells counts, IL-6 and IL-1beta secretion in co-cultured splenocytes, which was abrogated by QLY. QLY-containing serum suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK and p65 in AIA lymphocyte-stimulated normal monocytes and consequently inhibited iNOS and IL-1beta expression as well as IL-6 and IL-1beta production. Matrine, sinomenine and sophocarpine were identified as major bioactive compounds in QLY. These identified compounds effectively inhibited the development of inflammatory T cells using concentrations detected in QLY-treated rats. At higher concentrations (20-fold increase), the chemical stimuli significantly suppressed the production of IL-1beta in AIA monocytes by inhibiting JNK and p65 pathways. CONCLUSION: By targeting inflammatory T cells and monocytes as well as disrupting their interplay, QLY improved immune environment in RA models especially during the active stages of disease.

8441520|t|Steroid-responsive sensorineural hearing loss: combination therapy with prednisolone and Sairei-to.
8441520|a|We observed cases of hearing loss in which hearing deteriorated when steroid therapy was discontinued and improved upon re-administration. We identified these as cases of steroid-responsive sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The diagnostic criteria for determining steroid-responsive SNHL were stated, and 10 cases were examined. The 10 cases of steroid-responsive SNHL were divided into two groups: 3 cases associated with aortitis syndrome (systemic type) and 7 cases with no known systemic disease (localized type). Relatively satisfactory hearing was maintained in these cases by long-term oral administration of prednisolone (PSL). The combined use of Sairei-to made it possible to decrease the necessary maintenance dose of PSL. While the pathology of steroid-responsive SNHL is still unclear, it is suspected that immune complex disease or vasculitis may be involved.

28219365|t|Exploration of anti-cancer effects and mechanisms of Zuo-Jin-Wan and its alkaloid components in vitro and in orthotopic HepG2 xenograft immunocompetent mice.
28219365|a|BACKGROUND: Zuo-Jin-Wan (ZJW), a two-herb formula consisting of Coptis chinensis (CC) and Evodia rutaecarpa (ER), is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of cancers. However, the efficacies and mechanisms of ZJW and its alkaloid components on cancers are still unclear. METHODS: Here we investigated the anti-cancer effects and mechanisms of ZJW, CC, ER, berberine, and evodiamine in cells and in intrahepatic xenograft mice. RESULTS: Treatment of HepG2 cells with ZJW, CC, ER, berberine, and evodiamine significantly displayed cytotoxic effects in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression profiles showed that CC and ZJW shared a similar mechanism for the cytotoxic effects, suggesting that CC was the active ingredient of ZJW for anti-cancer activity. Network analysis further showed that c-myc was the likely key molecule involved in the regulation of ZJW-affected gene expression. A human hepatoma xenograft model was established by intrahepatic injection of HepG2 cells containing nuclear factor-kappaB-driven luciferase genes in immunocompetent mice. In vivo bioluminescence imaging showed that cells had been successfully transplanted in mouse liver. Oral administration of ZJW for 28 consecutive days led to a significant decrease in the accumulation of ascites, the ratio of tumor-to-liver, and the number of transplanted cells in livers. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our findings suggested for the first time that ZJW significantly suppressed human cancer cell growth in orthotopic HepG2 xenograft-bearing immunocompetent mice. Moreover, c-myc might play a potent role in the cytotoxic mechanisms of ZJW, CC, ER, berberine, and evodiamine.

34567219|t|Qi-Regulating and Blood Circulation-Promoting Therapy Improves Health Status of Stable Angina Pectoris Patients with Depressive Symptoms.
34567219|a|Depressive symptoms have been found to be highly prevalent among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and seriously affect the patients' quality of life. However, most psychotropic drugs have warnings about potential side effects. Accordingly, safer effective alternatives are urgently demanded. Angina pectoris of CHD is considered as "chest stuffiness and heartache syndrome" in traditional Chinese medicine, with the major syndrome type named Qi stagnation and blood stasis. Qi-regulating and blood circulation-promoting therapy has increasingly shown unique advantages in CHD patients. This study investigated the efficacy of Xuefu Zhuyu decoction, a representative prescription of Qi-regulating and blood circulation-promoting therapy, on angina pectoris patients with depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were stratified at baseline in 30 patients with stable angina pectoris who participated in both baseline and 12-week follow-up studies. After performing a stratified analysis, the angina pectoris-specific health status and traditional Chinese medicine "chest stuffiness and heartache syndrome" were evaluated by self-reports using the associated questionnaire scales, respectively. We measured serum concentrations of serotonin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and ATP, which are associated with the development of depression. We found that the Xuefu Zhuyu granule significantly improved the angina pectoris-specific health status in patients after 12 weeks of treatment; specifically, it had a better curative effect on patients with depressive symptoms. Xuefu Zhuyu granule also significantly improved the chest stuffiness and heartache syndrome in patients with depressive symptoms (efficacy index is 61.24%, P < 0.05 versus baseline). Interestingly, Xuefu Zhuyu granule has been found to be more susceptible to improving ATP levels in patients with depressive symptoms, indicating that the improvement in serum ATP levels might account for the better efficacy of Xuefu Zhuyu granule in patients with depressive symptoms. Our data provide prospective evidence that Xuefu Zhuyu granule improves angina pectoris-specific health status through regulating Qi and promoting blood circulation. This trial is registered with ChiCTR-IOR-15006989.

28629357|t|XuefuZhuyu decoction protected cardiomyocytes against hypoxia/reoxygenation injury by inhibiting autophagy.
28629357|a|BACKGROUND: XuefuZhuyu decoction (XFZY) is a well-known traditional Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases, such as unstable angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the mechanism by which XFZY contributes to the amelioration of cardiac injury remains unclear. METHODS: H9C2 cells were cultured under the hypoxic condition for 10 h and reoxygenated for 2 h. In the presence of various concentrations of XFZY for 12 h, the cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The protective effect of XFZY in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cell model was confirmed by measuring the amount of LDH released into the extracellular fluid. Cell apoptosis was measured by western blotting. The autophagy level of H9C2 cells and the correlative pathway were determined by transmission electron microscopy, Cyto-ID(R) Autophagy Detection Kit, and western blotting. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the effects of XFZY on H/R induced cardiac injury. The results showed that treatment with XFZY significantly inhibited autophagy induced by H/R, with decreased formation of autophagosomes as well as the expression of LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and Beclin 1 after H/R. Importantly, inhibition of autophagy by XFZY resulted in enhanced cell viability and decreased apoptosis. XFZY also inhibited the activation of AMPK and upregulated the phosphorylation of mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR). CONCLUSIONS: The cardioprotective effects of XFZY during H/R were mediated by inhibiting autophagy via regulating AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways.

34484403|t|Based on Network Pharmacology to Explore the Potential Bioactive Compounds and Mechanisms of Zuojin Pill for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis.
34484403|a|BACKGROUND: Zuojin Pill (ZJP), a classic prescription, has the potential to prevent ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the active components and mechanisms of ZJP are still arcane. This study aimed to use a network pharmacology approach to find the bioactive compounds and potential action mechanisms of ZJP in the treatment of UC. METHODS: Firstly, the components and putative targets of ZJP were collected based on herbal medicine target databases, and a network containing the interaction between the targets of ZJP and the potential therapeutic targets of UC was established. Then, topological parameters were calculated to identify the key targets in the network and, in turn, to import them into the David database to perform path enrichment analysis. RESULTS: 14 potential therapeutic components of ZJP and 26 key targets were obtained. These targets were related to signal transduction, MAPK cascade, inflammatory response, immune response, and the apoptotic process of UC. Moreover, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and Prolactin signaling pathway were predicted to participate in ZJP treating UC. Among them, 14 active components of ZJP directly regulate these pathways. CONCLUSION: ZJP could alleviate UC through the predicted components and mechanisms. The 14 predicted active components of ZJP may mainly play a therapeutic role for UC through synergistic regulation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway.

30618762|t|Integrating Network Pharmacology and Metabolomics Study on Anti-rheumatic Mechanisms and Antagonistic Effects Against Methotrexate-Induced Toxicity of Qing-Luo-Yin.
30618762|a|Qing-Luo-Yin (QLY) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula used to treat Hot Syndrome-related rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Previously, we uncovered partial mechanisms involved in the therapeutic actions of QLY on RA. In this study, we further elucidated its anti-rheumatic mechanisms and investigated its possible interactions with methotrexate (MTX) in vivo using an integrating strategy coupled with network pharmacology and metabolomics techniques. Chemical composition of QLY was characterized by HPLC analysis. Collagen induced arthritis (CIA) was developed in male SD rats. The CIA rats were then assigned into different groups, and received QLY, MTX or QLY+MTX treatments according to the pre-arrangement. Therapeutic effects of QLY and its possible interactions with MTX in vivo were evaluated by clinical parameters, digital radiography assessment, histological/immunohistochemical examination, and serological biomarkers. Mechanisms underlying these actions were deciphered with network pharmacology methods, and further validated by metabolomics clues based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis of urines. Experimental evidences demonstrated that QLY notably alleviated the severity of CIA and protected joints from destruction. Re-balanced levels of hemoglobin and alanine transaminase in serum indicated reduced MTX-induced hepatic injury and myelosuppression under the co-treatment of QLY. Network-based target prediction found dozens of RA related proteins as potential targets of QLY. Upon the further biological function enrichment analysis, we found that a large amount of them were involved in nucleotide metabolism and immune functions. Metabolomics analysis showed that QLY restored amino acids, fatty acids, and energy metabolisms in CIA rats, which solidly supported its therapeutic effects on CIA. Consistently to findings from network pharmacology analysis, metabolomics study also found altered purine, pyrimidine, and pentose phosphate metabolisms in CIA rats receiving QLY treatment. All these clues suggested that inhibition on nucleic acid synthesis was essential to the immunosuppressive activity of QLY in vivo, and could contribute great importance to its therapeutic effects on CIA. Additionally, QLY induced significant antifolate resistance in rats, which would prevent folate from depletion during long-term MTX treatment, and should account for reduced side effects in combination regimen with MTX and QLY.

METHODS: Healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham operation group (SOG); a model group (MG); and low-, median- and high-dose treatment groups (LDG, MDG, and HDG, respectively). Different dosages (6, 12 and 24 g/kg for the LDG, MDG, and HDG, respectively) of DCQD were administered to the rats with SAP. The tissue concentrations of aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol, honokiol, rheo chrysophanol, magnolol, hesperidin, naringenin and naringin in the liver of the treated rats were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in serum, inflammatory mediators in the liver and pathological scores were evaluated. RESULTS: The major components of DCQD were detected in the liver, and their concentrations increased dose-dependently. The high dose of DCQD showed a maximal effect in ameliorating the pathological damages, decreasing the pro-inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 and increasing anti-inflammatory mediators IL-4 and IL-10 in the liver. The pathological scores in the pancreas for the MG were significantly higher than those for the SOG (P < 0.05). DCQD could reduce the pathological scores in the pancreas and liver of the rats with SAP, especially in the HDG. Compared to the SOG, the ALT and AST levels in serum were higher in the MG (P < 0.05), while there was no statistical difference in the MG and HDG. CONCLUSION: DCQD could alleviate liver damage by altering the inflammatory response in rats with SAP based on the liver distribution of its components.

32132347|t|Protective Effect of Tong-Qiao-Huo-Xue Decoction on Inflammatory Injury Caused by Intestinal Microbial Disorders in Stroke Rats.
32132347|a|Tong-Qiao-Huo-Xue Decoction (TQHXD) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine prescription for treating cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of TQHXD on intervening inflammatory response of ischemic stroke by regulating intestinal flora and repairing the intestinal barrier. A rat model of cerebral ischemia was established using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and behavioral scores were performed. Additionally, the high throughput 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples of rat was also carried out. Our results showed that TQHXD could change the main components of intestinal flora in stroke rats, and reduced the excessive increase of Bacteroidetes, and also regulated the abnormal changes of abundance of some flora as well. In addition, the intestinal epithelial barrier was damaged after stroke, allowing bacterial metabolites to enter the blood, while TQHXD had an improved effect on this phenomenon. Meanwhile, pathological changes in the brain tissue and infarct volume were also alleviated by TQHXD. Due to the disorder of the intestinal flora and the destruction of the barrier, the peripheral immune imbalance caused an inflammatory reaction. TQHXD improved the imbalance of T cells, and inhibited the inflammatory response. Finally, the therapeutic transplantation of fecal microbiota also improved the outcome of stroke in rats. Our presented results suggest that TQHXD may improve the gut microbiota disorder and its induced inflammatory response after stroke, which could be a new target and mechanism for the treatment of stroke.

26165371|t|Immunomodulation and liver protection of Yinchenhao decoction against concanavalin A-induced chronic liver injury in mice.
26165371|a|OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the immunoregulatory and protective roles of Yinchenhao decoction, a compound of Chinese herbal medicine, in a mouse model of concanavalin A (ConA)-induced chronic liver injury. METHODS: Female BalB/c mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal control, ConA model, ConA model treated with Yinchenhao decoction (400 mg/kg, orally), and ConA model treated with dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg, orally). All treatments were given once a day for 28 d. Except of the normal control, mice received tail vein injection of ConA (10 mg/kg) on days 7, 14, 21, and 28, at 1 h after treatment with Yinchenhao decoction or dexamethasone or saline to induce chronic liver injury. RESULTS: Repeated ConA injection induced chronic liver injury, which was evidenced by inflammatory cell infiltration and necrosis, increased serum alanine aminotranferease activities, decreased albumin levels, and an imbalanced expression of immunoregulatory genes in the liver tissues including significantly enhanced interferon-gamma, interleukin-4, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and cluster of differentiation 163 mRNA levels, and reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 mRNA levels. Treatment with Yinchenhao decoction significantly reversed the ConA-induced changes in immunoregulatory gene expression in the liver tissues, reduced serum alanine aminotranferease activity, enhanced serum albumin level, and attenuated the extent of liver inflammation and necrosis. Furthermore, Yinchenhao decoction did not result in hepatocyte degeneration and spleen weight loss that were observed in mice received long-term treatment with dexamethasone. CONCLUSION: Yinchenhao decoction treatment protected liver against the ConA-induced chronic liver damage and improved liver function, which were associated with the modulation of gene expression related to immune/inflammatory response.

34485118|t|Sanhuang Decoction Controls Tumor Microenvironment by Ameliorating Chronic Stress in Breast Cancer: A Report of Ninety Cases.
34485118|a|Long-term endocrine treatment which results in estrogen deprivation causes chronic stress associated with a series of uncomfortable symptoms leading not only to a decrease in quality of life but also to cancer recurrence, which may be mediated primarily through the enhanced expression of angiogenic factors, as well as a series of inflammatory microenvironmental changes that favor tumor progression. In this study, we designed a clinical trial and aimed to explore the effects of Sanhuang Decoction (SHD) treatment on chronic stress, inflammatory factors, and breast cancer recovery. A total of 90 patients with breast cancer who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomly allocated to a treatment or control group. The treatment group received the standard endocrine treatment and the traditional Chinese medicine decoction known as SHD. The control group received the standard endocrine treatment only. The treatment period was 6 months. The modified Kupperman Menopausal Index, the self-rating anxiety scale, and the self-rating depression scale were evaluated once per month. The body microenvironment plasma indices related to chronic stress, such as oxidative and antioxidative stress markers, inflammatory factors, hemorheology, coagulation, lipid and D-dimer, immunologic functions, tumor biomarkers, and angiogenic factors of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured before and after 6 months of treatment. After treatment for 5 months, the scores in the treatment group decreased to nearly normal levels and the control group showed no significant improvement. After treatment for 6 months, all indices related to the body microenvironment, as well as the tumor biomarkers and carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 153, and angiogenic factor VEGF levels improved significantly to normal levels in the treatment group. Our primary research showed that treatment with SHD effectively improved the quality of life of breast cancer patients by facilitating a change in the body microenvironment that controlled tumor growth and prevented drug resistance. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, identifier ChiCTR-IIR-2000041413. Date of registration: 2017-06-07 (retrospective registration).

10482472|t|Effects of Kakkon-to and Sairei-to on experimental elevation of aqueous flare in pigmented rabbits.
10482472|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the possible inhibitory effects of Kakkon-to and Sairei-to, traditional Sino-Japanese herbal medicines, on experimental aqueous flare elevation in pigmented rabbits. METHODS: Anterior uveitis was induced either by an application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 10 microg/mL, to the cornea, or an intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), 0.5 microg/kg, in an ear vein. Dose dependency of experimental uveitis induced by LPS (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 microg/kg) was also determined. For pretreatment, about 150 g/day of food containing Kakkon-to (1% w/w) or Sairei-to (0.6% or 2% w/w) was given to two groups of animals for 5 days before experimental uveitis was induced. A third group of animals underwent pretreatment with betamethasone, 130 microg/kg, injection into an ear vein 4 hours before experimental uveitis was induced. A fourth group of rabbits with no herbal medicine or betamethasone pretreatment served as controls. Aqueous flare was measured using a laser flare-cell meter. Aqueous flare intensity was expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) in arbitrary units. RESULTS: The increase in aqueous flare induced by LPS was dose-dependent. The AUC of PGE2 (10 microg/mL) and LPS (0.5 microg/mL) induced aqueous flare elevations were 1,119 and 4,950 arbitrary units, respectively. Kakkon-to (AUC, 1,055) and Sairei-to (AUC, 965) did not inhibit the aqueous flare elevation induced by PGE2. Beta-methasone did inhibit the elevation (AUC, 271). Kakkon-to (AUC, 4,495) did not suppress the aqueous flare elevation induced by LPS. Both 0.6% and 2% Sairei-to (AUC, 2,478, and 978) and beta-methasone (AUC, 443) did suppress the aqueous flare elevation induced by LPS significantly (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Sairei-to could have an inhibitory effect on experimental anterior uveitis induced by LPS.

24092243|t|Liuwei dihuang pills enhance the effect of Western medicine in treating type 2 diabetes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
24092243|a|OBJECTIVE: To perform meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of adding Liuwei Dihuang Pills (, LDP) to Western medicine in improving treatment outcomes for type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases, including the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched to identify eligible studies; i.e., if the study involved a randomized clinical trial in which the experimental group combined LDP with Western drugs and the control group used the corresponding Western drugs alone to treat type 2 diabetes. Outcomes were measured in terms of fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial blood glucose (2hPG) and HbA1c level. Efficacy was also measured by using control and response rates. The combined odds ratio (OR), mean difference (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Studies included in the analysis were less adequate than expected in terms of methodological quality. A total of 1,609 patients from 18 studies were included. We found that adding LDP can lower patients' FBG (MD=0.54 mmol/L, 95% CI [0.15, 0.93], P=0.007), 2hPG (MD=1.05 mmol/L, 95% CI [0.29, 1.81], P<0.01) and HbA1c (MD=0.23, 95% CI [0.02, 0.45], P=0.008). There were also improvements in treatment response rates (OR=3.41, 95% CI [2.38, 4.90], P<0.01) and control rates (OR=2.47, 95% CI [1.91, 3.20], P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Adding LDP to Western medicine might improve treatment outcomes of diabetes, including FBG, 2hPG, response rates and control rates.

33841161|t|Palmul-Tang, a Korean Medicine, Promotes Bone Formation via BMP-2 Pathway in Osteoporosis.
33841161|a|Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease in post-menopausal women. Palmul-tang, an herbal medicine, has been treated for gynecological disease such as anemia, anorexia, anti-fatigue, unspecified menstruation and female infertility in East Asia. In this study, ameliorative effects of Palmul-tang soft extracts (PMT), a Korean Medicine, on osteoporosis were investigated. Ovariectomized (OVX) osteoporotic ICR mice were intragastrically administrated PMT for 4 weeks. The level of bone mineral density (BMD) was analyzed in bone tissues by dual X-ray absorptiometry. The bone medullary cavity and deposition of collagen were investigated by histological analysis. In addition, the BMP-2 signaling-related molecules, osteoblastic differentiation and formation markers, were determined in femoral tissues. The levels of BMD and bone mineral content were significantly increased in tibia, femurs and LV by treatment of PMT. PMT replenished bone marrow cavity and increased collagen deposition in bone marrow cells of femur. In addition, administration of PMT recovered serum ALP, bALP, osteocalcin and calcium levels in osteoporotic mice. Moreover, PMT treatment up-regulated the expressions of BMP-2, RUNX2 and OSX with its downstream factors, ALP, OPN and BSP-1, in the femoral tissues. Taken together, PMT restored the bone minerals and improvement of bone integrity by bone-forming BMP-2 signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that PMT could be an ameliorative agent for osteoporosis.

29311939|t|Huangqi Decoction Alleviates Alpha-Naphthylisothiocyanate Induced Intrahepatic Cholestasis by Reversing Disordered Bile Acid and Glutathione Homeostasis in Mice.
29311939|a|Intrahepatic cholestasis is a serious symptom of liver disorders with limited therapies. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of Huangqi decoction (HQD), a two-herb classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), in the treatment of alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced intrahepatic cholestasis in mice. HQD treatment ameliorated impaired hepatic function and tissue damage. A metabolomics study revealed that the endogenous metabolites significantly affected by HQD were related to bile acid (BA) biosynthesis and glutathione metabolism pathways. HQD treatment decreased the intrahepatic accumulation of cytotoxic BAs, normalized serum BA levels, and increased biliary and urinary BA excretion. Additionally, HQD restored the hepatic glutathione content and suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cholestatic mice. Protein and gene analysis revealed that HQD increased the expression of the hepatic metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B10 and UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), as well as multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), Mrp3, and Mrp4, which play crucial roles in BA homeostasis. Further, HQD increased the protein expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase, which is involved in the synthesis of glutathione. Importantly, HQD increased the nuclear expression of nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). In conclusion, HQD protects against intrahepatic cholestasis by reversing the disordered homeostasis of BAs and glutathione.

29576800|t|Effects of Huanglian Jiedu Decoration in Rat Gingivitis.
29576800|a|Gingivitis is an inflammatory disease that affects gingival tissues through a microbe-immune interaction. Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJD) is used traditionally for clearing and detoxifying in China, which had been reported to possess many pharmacological effects. Rat gingival inflammation model was established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection for 3 consecutive days, and HLJD was given by gavage before LPS injection. After 3 days rats were sacrificed and tissue samples were evaluated. Serum cytokine levels such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Oxidative stress related molecules such as total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined. Expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway were inspected by western blotting. Histological changes of gingival tissues were tested with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. HLJD significantly decreased serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, suppressed generation of MDA and ROS, and enhanced T-AOC creation. Moreover, HLJD inhibited expressions of AMPK and ERK1/2. The inflammation severity of gingival tissue by HE staining was severe in model group but relieved in HLJD group obviously. HLJD exhibited protective effects against gingival damage through suppressing inflammation reaction and elevating antioxidation power.

9349884|t|The herbal medicine, sairei-to, prevents endotoxin-induced otitis media with effusion in the guinea pig.
9349884|a|With current pharmacotherapy, otitis media with effusion (OME) is often recurrent and even develops to become chronic. There is now considerable experimental and clinical evidence that the cilia in the tubotympanum play an important part in the prevention of OME. A herbal medicine, sairei-to, has been shown to stimulate the ciliary activity in vitro, and oral administration of the medicine also stimulated the ciliary activity in the tubotympanum rather than physiological states. This study was designed to investigate whether oral administration of sairei-to could prevent experimental OME in the guinea pig. A total of 120 guinea pigs were used. The control group was treated with intratympanic injection of 0.1 ml of physiologic saline solution. The saline-control group was treated with oral administration of physiologic saline solution for 14 successive days. The low-dosage group and the high-dosage group were treated with oral administration of 120 and 600 mg/kg of sairei-to for 14 successive days, respectively. The saline-control group, the low-dosage group and the high-dosage group were then treated with intratympanic injection of 0.1 ml of lipopolysaccharide solution (100 micrograms/ml) derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae. All 10 animals from the 4 groups were sacrificed 1, 3, and 7 days after the intratympanic injection, to examine ciliary activity, mucociliary clearance time, and mucosal pathology of the tubotympanum. The saline-control group exhibited middle ear effusions and pathologies similar to human OME. The incidence of middle ear effusions in the low-dosage and the high-dosage groups was somewhat reduced compared with the saline-control group. The ciliary activity in the tubotympanum was significantly reduced in the saline-control and low-dosage groups compared with the normal-control group. By contrast, the magnitude of reduction in ciliary activity was much smaller in the high-dosage group. The ciliary activity especially in the Eustachian tube and the middle ear close to the tympanic orifice at 3 and 7 days in the high-dosage group was not significantly different from that in the normal-control group. Mucociliary clearance time in the high-dosage group was not different from that in the normal-control group throughout the observation period. The groups treated with sairei-to, especially the high-dosage group, exhibited much milder pathological changes in the tubotympanum than did the saline-control group. In conclusion, clinical application of sairei-to could be an effective measure to prevent the occurrence of OME and also the recurrence of the disease, especially OME-prone individuals.

34765515|t|Kihito prevents corticosterone-induced brain dysfunctions in mice.
34765515|a|Kihito (KIT; Gui Pi Tang) is a traditional herbal medicine that is used for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, neurosis and insomnia in China and Japan. Recently, it has also been shown that KIT improves cognitive dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In this study, to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of KIT on stress-induced brain dysfunctions such as a depressed state and memory impairment, we examined whether KIT prevents behavioral and neurophysiological abnormalities in mice treated chronically with corticosterone (CORT). CORT (40 mg/kg/day, s.c.) and KIT (1000 mg/kg/day, p.o.) were given to 7-week-old male ddY mice for 14 days. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, depression-like behavior in the forced swim test, spatial memory in the Barnes maze test, cell survival and the number of new-born immature neurons, dendritic spine density and expression levels of mRNA for neurotrophic factors were analyzed. Depression-like behavior and spatial memory impairment were observed in CORT-treated mice without KIT treatment. Hippocampal cell survival, the number of hippocampal new-born immature neurons, hippocampal and accumbal dendritic spine density and mRNA levels for neurotrophic factors such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were decreased in CORT-treated mice without KIT treatment. KIT prevented CORT-induced depression-like behavior, spatial memory impairment, and decreases in hippocampal cell survival, the number of hippocampal new-born immature neurons, accumbal dendritic spine density and GDNF mRNA. KIT may ameliorate stress-induced brain dysfunctions via prevention of adverse effects of CORT on cell survival, new-born immature neurons, spine density and neurotrophic factors.

28824465|t|Effects of Kamikihito and Unkei-to on Sleep Behavior of Wild Type and Parkinson Model in Drosophila.
28824465|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and it is associated with sleep behavior disorders. In Drosophila melanogaster disease model, human alpha-synuclein A30P overexpressing flies (A30P PD model) have been shown for levy body aggregation and movement disorders. We measured sleep rhythms in the A30P PD model flies using the Drosophila Activity Monitoring system and found that they develop sleep defects at 20 days after eclosion. Furthermore, the total amount of sleep is significantly reduced in middle-aged PD model flies and the reduction has been attributed to nighttime sleep. The number and length of sleep bouts also decreased in middle-aged A30P PD model flies. Feeding of the oriental traditional herbal medicines (Kampo), Kamikihito and Unkei-to significantly ameliorate the level of sleep defects in A30P PD model flies. The Kamikihito and Unkei-to recovered 60-min sleep bouts number in the A30P PD model flies to the level of young (5 days after eclosion) flies. Kamikihito recovered sleep both in wild-type and PD model flies. Unkei-to ameliorates not only sleep but also motor function in PD model flies. The data suggest that Kamikihito and Unkei-to might be useful for the sleep defects in human PD patients as well as healthy human.

30415587|t|Ma Huang Tang ameliorates bronchial asthma symptoms through the TLR9 pathway.
30415587|a|CONTEXT: Ma Huang Tang (MHT) has been used to treat influenza, fever, bronchial asthma, etc. as a traditional Chinese medication. However, the anti-inflammation mechanism of MHT remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The study identifies the possible mechanisms of MHT on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced acute bronchial asthma in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, an asthma-related protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. And then, the acute bronchial asthma mice models were established by exposing to aerosolized 1% ovalbumin for 30 min/day for 1 week, and the mice were administered 2.0, 4.0, or 8.0 g/kg of MHT daily. To evaluate therapeutic effect, sensitization time, abdominal breathing time, eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and tissue and trachea pathology were examined. Related genes were measured using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The expression levels of TLR9 in lung and trachea tissues were determined by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: MHT had a LD50 = 19.2 g/kg against asthma, while MHT at high doses (8 g/kg) effectively extended the sensitization time and abdominal breathing time and alleviated OVA-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation and mitigated pathological changes. The RNA-seq assay showed that the high-dose MHT resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of TLR9, TRAF6, TAB2, etc. in the lung tissue. Immunohistochemical assay confirmed the down-regulated of TLR9. Molecular docking revealed that six MHT compounds potentially mediated the TLR9 signaling pathway. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: MHT could mitigate the pathological changes of acute asthma-like syndrome through inhibition of the TLR9 pathway. Results of this study may provide a reference for the development of a novel therapy for patients with allergic asthma.

33628326|t|Research on Effect and Mechanism of Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction on CHD Based on Meta-Analysis and Network Pharmacology.
33628326|a|Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction (XFZY) is an ancient compound widely used in the treatment of coronary heart disease. However, its efficacy evaluation is not complete and its mechanism of action is not clear enough. In an attempt to address these problems, the efficacy was evaluated by meta-analysis and the mechanism was elucidated by the network pharmacology method. We systematically searched relevant studies in PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Cochrane Library, Wanfang Data, and other databases from 2007 to 2019. The association between XFZY treatment and CHD was estimated by risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The compounds and the potential protein targets of XFZY were obtained from TCMSP, and active compounds were selected according to their oral bioavailability and drug similarity. The potential genes of coronary heart disease were obtained from TTD, OMIM, and GeneCards. The potential pathways related to genes were determined by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. The compound-target and compound-target-pathway networks were constructed. Molecular docking validates the component and the target. A total of 21 studies including 1844 patients were enrolled in the present meta-analysis, indicating that XFZY has a greater beneficial on total effect (fixed effect RR = 1.30; 95% Cl: 1.24-1.36; P=0.82; I (2) = 0.0%) and electrocardiogram efficacy (fixed effect RR = 1.40; 95% Cl: 1.26-1.56; P=0.96; I (2) = 0.0%) compared with the control group. A total of 1342 components in XFZY were obtained, among which, 241 were chosen as bioactive components. GO and KEGG analyses got top 10 significantly enriched terms and 10 enriched pathways. The C-T network included 192 compounds and 3085 targets, whereas the C-T-P network included 10 compounds, 109 targets, and 5 pathways. There was a good binding activity between the components and the targets. XFZY has the curative effect on coronary heart disease, and its mechanism is related to 10 compounds, 10 core targets, and 5 pathways.

35182668|t|Effect of Shixiao San on inflammatory factors and pain in rats with endometriosis.
35182668|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In the practice of traditional Chinese medicine, endometriosis is believed to be caused by blood stasis and is characterised by dysmenorrhea, which is difficult to control. Shixiao San (SXS) has a long history of use in the treatment of gynaecological diseases. The prescriptions composed of SXS include Typhae Pollen and Faeces Trogopterori, both of which have anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, Typhae Pollen can be used to treat many kinds of blood stasis diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of SXS on pain relief in rats with endometriosis and to preliminarily explore its mechanism of action in alleviating pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten rats received sham operation as the Sham group, and 30 endometriosis model rats were randomly divided into three groups: the Model, Shixiao San-Low (SXS-L), and Shixiao San-High (SXS-H) groups. The rats were administered the appropriate treatment via intragastric gavage for 4 weeks. The thermal radiation pain and mechanical pain thresholds of the rats were measured every 7 days after treatment. Finally, the distribution density of nerve fibres in endometrial tissue, the inflammatory infiltration of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), the expression of TRPV1 in the DRG, and the expression of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in ectopic tissue were measured. RESULTS: After SXS treatment, the growth of ectopic tissue in rats with endometriosis was significantly suppressed, their thermal radiation pain and mechanical pain thresholds increased, the density of nerve fibres and the expression of inflammatory factors in ectopic tissues reduced, and inflammatory cells infiltration in the DRG of the animals alleviated. Meanwhile, the expression of TRPV1 in the DRG was downregulated in rats with endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS: SXS could possibly inhibit the development of endometriosis and relieve pain in patients with endometriosis by reducing inflammatory responses in ectopic tissue and the DRG.

23598923|t|Screening of the antidepressant-like effect of the traditional Chinese medicinal formula Si-Ni-San and their possible mechanism of action in mice.
23598923|a|BACKGROUND: The traditional Chinese medicine formula Si-Ni-San has well therapeutic applications in improvement of mental diseases including depression. However, the neuropharmacological and neuroendocrine mechanisms of the formula on antidepressant-like action have not been reported. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we explored the antidepressant-like effect and its mechanism of Si-Ni-San. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acute effect of Si-Ni-San on the immobility time was assessed in the mouse forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Moreover, we investigated the neurochemical, neuroendocrine, and neurotrophin systems involved in the antidepressant-like effect of this formula. RESULTS: Si-Ni-San significantly decreased the immobility time after acute treatment in the mouse TST (1300 mg/kg) but not in the FST compared with the control group. In addition, pretreatment of mice with PCPA or AMPT prevented the anti-immobility effect of Si-Ni-San (1300 mg/kg) in the TST. Moreover, acute Si-Ni-San (1300 mg/kg) decreased serum corticosterone levels, elevated serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) levels without affecting brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the whole brain exposed to TST. CONCLUSION: The acute antidepressant-like action of Si-Ni-San is mediated by the monoaminergic and neuroendocrine systems although underlying mechanism still remains to be further elucidated, and this formula should be further investigated as an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of depression.

25133542|t|Coptidis rhizome and Si Jun Zi Tang can prevent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection in mice.
25133542|a|Salmonella, a common zoonotic pathogen, causes gastroenteritis in both humans and animals. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used to improve gastrointestinal dysfunction and to modify the immune response to inflammation for centuries. This study used six herbal plants and four TCM formulae to rate their efficacy in preventing S. Typhimurium infection via mouse model. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Coptidis rhizome (CR) against the reference strain tallied 12.5 mg/ml and against clinical isolate ST21 was 25 mg/ml. MBCs of other herbal extracts and formulae on Salmonella Typhimurium strains were above 50 mg/ml. In the mice model, CR and Si Jun Zi Tang (SJZT) could significantly decrease the bacterial load in organs and blood after being challenged, along with body weight loss due to the infection. CR and SJZT alleviated infection-induced interferon-gamma levels in the serum and tissues, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in intestinal tissues. CR and SJZT serum metabolites could suppress S. Typhimurium invasion and TNF-alpha expression in RAW264.7 cells. The therapeutic activity of CR and SJZT may involve berberine, ginsenoside Rb1, and glycyrrhizin, interfering with Salmonella when invading macrophages. CR and SJZT has shown potential in preventing S. Typhimurium infection through the regulation of the immune response.

34665368|t|Protective Roles of Xijiao Dihuang Tang on Coronary Artery Injury in Kawasaki Disease.
34665368|a|PURPOSE: Xijiao Dihuang Tang (XJDHT) is a classical formula of traditional Chinese medicine constituted of Cornu Bubali, Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn.) DC., Paeonia lactiflora Pall., and Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews. It was first mentioned in the medical classic "Beiji Qianjin Yaofang" written by Simiao Sun in Tang Dynasty. It shows very strong antipyretic and anticoagulant effects and has been clinically applied to treat various type of blood loss, purple and black spots, heat stroke, and glossitis. Kawasaki disease (KD) is considered as a kind of acute febrile illness in children with systemic vasculitis as the main lesions. The aim of this research is to clarify whether XJDHT can play a protective role in KD. METHODS: A mouse model of Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS)-induced coronary arteritis and a KD cell model with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha induction were employed to investigate the potential effect and mechanism of XJDHT on coronary artery injury in KD. RESULTS: Data showed that XJDHT remarkably alleviated the coronary artery injury of KD mice, as evidenced by reduced inflammation and downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and TNF-alpha. In vitro investigation showed that XJDHT could promote cell proliferation, inhibit cell apoptosis, and improve mitochondrial functions. Subsequent studies demonstrated that XJDHT rescued endothelial cell injury by PI3K/Akt-NFkappaB signaling pathway. Component analysis of XJDHT detected thirty-eight chemically active ingredients, including paeoniflorin, albiflorin, and paeoniflorigenone, which in in vitro experiments exhibited significant rescue effects on TNF-alpha-mediated endothelial cell injury. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that XJDHT mitigated coronary artery injury of KD through suppressing endothelial cell damage via PI3K/Akt-NFkappaB signaling.

31217889|t|Huangqi decoction inhibits hyperglycemia-induced podocyte apoptosis by down-regulated Nox4/p53/Bax signaling in vitro and in vivo.
31217889|a|BACKGROUND: Podocyte dysfunction is associated with the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Huangqi decoction (HQD), a traditional Chinese medical formula, has been used to improve diabetes-related syndrome in China. The present study was to investigate the protective effect of HQD on podocyte apoptosis and the underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: Podocyte was used to measure the efficacy of HQD on cell apoptosis, activities of NADPH oxidases, ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and the activation of Nox4/p53/Bax signaling pathway with HQD treatment were also investigated in vitro. Renal pathological morphology, renal function, podocyte apoptosis and Nox4/p53/Bax signaling pathway were investigated with STZ-induced diabetic mice in vivo. RESULTS: HQD increased the cell proliferation and MMP level, while the ROS production and activities of NADPH oxidases were decreased. Meanwhile, Nox4/p53/Bax signaling was down-regulated. Contrarily, overexpression of Nox4 or p53 significantly abolished those efficacies of HQD. Accordingly, in vivo study showed that the progressive albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and loss of podocytes were significantly alleviated with HQD treatment in diabetic mice, which paralleled by the marked inhibition of Nox4/p53/Bax signaling. CONCLUSION: Collectively, we provide further evidence that HQD had a renoprotective effect in preventing podocyte apoptosis, which was mediated at least in part by down-regulation of Nox4/p53/Bax signaling.

35399623|t|Er-Chen Decoction Alleviates High-Fat Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Rats through Remodeling Gut Microbiota and Regulating the Serum Metabolism.
35399623|a|Many studies have found that the dysfunction in gut microbiota and the metabolic dysfunction can promote nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development. Er-Chen decoction (EC) can be used in the treatment of NAFLD. However, the mechanism of this hepatoprotection is still unknown. In this study, we constructed a rat model with NAFLD fed with high-fat chow and administered EC treatment. The therapeutic effects of EC on NAFLD were evaluated by measuring transaminases, blood lipid levels, and pathological changes in the liver. In addition, we measured the effects of EC on liver inflammatory response and oxidative stress. The changes in gut microbiota after EC treatment were studied using 16S rRNA sequencing. Serum untargeted metabolomics analysis was also used to study the metabolic regulatory mechanisms of EC on NAFLD. The results showed that EC decreased the serum transaminases and lipid levels and improved the pathological changes in NAFLD rats. Furthermore, EC enhanced the activities of SOD and GSH-Px and decreased MDA level in the liver. EC treatment also decreased the gene and protein levels of IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha in the liver and serum. The 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics indicated that EC treatment affected the gut microbiota and regulated serum metabolism. Correlation analysis showed that the effects of EC on taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and vitamin B6 metabolism pathways were associated with affecting in the abundance of Lactobacillus, Dubosiella, Lachnospiraceae, Desulfovibri, Romboutsia, Akkermansia, Intestinimonas, and Candidatus_saccharimonas in the gut. In conclusion, our study confirmed the protective effect of EC on NAFLD. EC could treat NAFLD by inhibiting oxidative stress, reducing inflammatory responses, and improving the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the modulation of the taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and vitamin B6 metabolism pathways in serum.

19548444|t|[Syndrome identification of CCl4 induced liver fibrosis model rats based on syndrome detecting from recipe used].
19548444|a|OBJECTIVE: To further demonstrate the cognition upon the prominent effect of Yiguanjian and Xiayuxue Decoction on the CCI4 induced rat model of chronic liver fibrosis which have been verified in the previous studies. From the viewpoint of detecting TCM syndrome by recipe used, through this cognition the pathological features of the liver injury model manifesting a syndrome of "Gan-yin deficiency with blood stasis obstructing collaterals" were further explored. METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into the normal group, the model group, and the three medicated groups. All rats, except those in the normal group, were made into chronic liver injury model by subcutaneously injecting CCI4 for 12 weeks. Medication for the three medicated groups began from the 9th week after modeling, with oral administering of Yiguanjian (YGJ, a recipe has been verified to be effective for liver injury and fibrosis), Liuwei Dihuang Decoction (LWDH, a recipe with effects similar to YGJ) and Yinchenhao Decoction (YCHD, a recipe functioned differently) respectively for four weeks. Rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, changes of hepatic function, liver pathology and hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in the liver tissue were detected, and contents of Afamin and mRNA expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in the liver tissue were assayed as well with Real-time PCR. RESULTS: As compared with the normal group, the pathological figures of the chronic liver injury and fibrosis and hepatic function deterioration obviously appeared in the model rats, with the liver content of Hyp and alpha-SMA mRNA expression increased, and Afamin mRNA expression decreased significantly. In the YGJ treated group, the hepatic collagen hyperplasia and deteriorated hepatic function alleviated significantly after treatment, with content of Hyp significantly lowered, and mRNA expressions of alpha-SMA and Afamin restored to some extent (P < 0.05); the same effects on mRNA expressions of alpha-SMA and Afamin were shown in the LWDH treated group, also a decreasing trend of Hyp content (0.05 < P < 0.1), and a significant decreasing of alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was found; while in the YCHD treated group these pharmacological effects mentioned above were not observed at all. CONCLUSION: The pharmacological effects of LWDH and YGJ were similar to some degree, which gives support to the cognition that the feature of chronic liver injury model rat induced by CCI4 is attributable to yin-deficiency sydrome.

35294130|t|Mechanism underlying the effect of Liujunzi decoction on advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer in patients after first-line chemotherapy.
35294130|a|OBJECTIVE: To further clarify the anticancer mechanisms of Liujunzi decoction and provide possible targets for the treatment of advanced-stage nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by re-analyzing differential gene expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Liujunzi decoctiontreated NSCLC patients receiving first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: The PBMC gene expression microarray data set GSE61926 was retrieved from a high throughput gene expression database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by paired sample t-test and the multiple ratio method. Gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed using the DAVID database. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using interaction gene library retrieval tools and Cytoscape software. RESULTS: A total of 162 DEGs were identified, with 67 upregulated genes and 95 downregulated genes. The functional distribution of Gene Oncology (GO) genes showed that DEGs were mostly concentrated in extracellular regions, calcium ion binding, and transcriptase activity. KEGG pathway analysis showed that cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions were significantly enriched. PPI network analysis screened out the top 10 central protein-coding genes with the highest nodal degree: IL2, PIWIL4, DICER1, PIWIL2, SAA1, XCL1, IL22RA1, ARHGAP11A, DCP1A, and GDNF. Among them, the central protein-coding gene with the highest node degree was IL2. In addition, the central protein-coding genes with high node degrees and high molecular complex detection (MCODE) scores were PIWIL4, DICER1, PIWIL2, and DCP1A, all of which are related to tumor development. CONCLUSIONS: One signaling pathway and 10 central protein-coding genes related to anticancer mechanisms were screened by re-analysis of GSE61926 data. IL2, PIWIL4, DICER1, PIWIL2, and DCP1A may have important roles in the mechanism of Liujunzi decoction treatment against NSCLC. Our results suggest that the anticancer mechanism of Liujunzi decoction may be related to gene silencing by RNA and the biological processes of piwi-interacting RNA and other small RNAs.

28763748|t|The therapeutic effects of Yongdamsagan-tang on autoimmune hepatitis models.
28763748|a|Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an immunity disorder that is the result of antibodies in the liver tissue of the patient that are attacked by activated immune cells due to an unknown cause. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Yongdamsagan-tang (YST) extracts and confirm effects on autoimmune hepatitis models as the therapeutic agent using the YST extracted by various solvents. YST, a mixture of 11 herbal extracts, is known in traditional Korean medicine as a widely used treatment for inflammatory diseases. We proposed the AIH-condition in vitro model by the addition of recombinant IL-17A and then observed several markers linked to AIH symptoms, including an increase of IL-6 expression, lipid accumulation, and fibrosis. In AIH-condition hepatic cell model, YST reduced IL-6 expression and lipid accumulation caused by treatment of IL-17 combination in hepatocyte cells. Also, YST blocked several activated fibrosis factors including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- beta1), collagen type 1 (Col-alpha1(I)), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in liver stellate cells. Furthermore, pretreatment with YST protected hepatic damage and reduces histological injury by suppressing apoptosis mediator and inflammatory cytokines expression in concanavalin A (Con A)-induced autoimmune hepatitis mice model. The findings here improve our understanding of YST extracted by 80% ethanol, suggesting that YST can be used as a therapeutic treatment for AIH.

24389028|t|The traditional Chinese medicine prescription patterns for migraine patients in Taiwan: a population-based study.
24389028|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), when given for symptom relief, has gained widespread popularity among migraine patients. The aim of this study is to analyze the utilization of TCM among migraine patients in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The usage, frequency of service, and the Chinese herbal products prescribed for migraine were evaluated using a representative sample of one million subjects selected at random from the 22 million beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance scheme of Taiwan. RESULTS: Overall, 89.3% (N=12,827) migraine patients utilized TCM and 24.2% of them sought TCM with the intention of treating their migraine-related symptoms. Migraine patients who are living in urban area and those with an episodic migraine pattern (<15 days/month) (aOR=3.18, 95% CI: 2.75-3.67) were more likely to be TCM users than those living in a rural area and those who suffered from chronic migraine (>/=15 days/month) (aOR=1.00). Overall, 81.2% of TCM visits involved the prescription of a Chinese herbal remedy or remedies and Chuan-Xiong-Cha-Tiao-San, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, Ge-Gen-Tang, Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang, Ban-Xia-Bai-Zhu-Tian-Ma-Tang, Qing-Shang-Juan-Tong-Tang, Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang, Tian-Ma-Gou-Teng-Yin, Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang, and Tian-Wang-Bu-Xin-Dan were the ten most frequently prescribed formula for treating migraine based on syndrome differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Chuan-Xiong-Cha-Tiao-San, which contains sedative and anti-inflammatory agents, is the most commonly prescribed Chinese herbal formula for the treatment of migraine-related phenomena.

35369960|t|Effective fraction from Simiao Wan prevents hepatic insulin resistant by inhibition of lipolysis via AMPK activation.
35369960|a|Simiao Wan (SMW) is a traditional Chinese formula, including Atractylodis Rhizoma, Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix, Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex and Coicis Semen at the ratio of 1:1:2:2. It can be used to the treatment of diabetes. However, its bioactive compounds and underlying mechanism are unclear. This study aimed to screen the antilipolytic fraction from SMW and investigate its therapeutic mechanisms on hepatic insulin resistance. Different fractions of SMW were prepared by membrane separation combined with macroporous resin and their antilipolytic activities were screened in fasted mice. The effects of 60% ethanol elution (ESMW) on lipolysis were investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by palmitic acid (PA) and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In our study, ESMW is the bioactive fraction responsible for the antilipolytic activity of SMW and 13 compounds were characterized from ESMW by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. ESMW suppressed protein kinase A (PKA)-hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) related lipolysis and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in PA challenged 3T3-L1 adipocytes. AMPKalpha knockdown abolished the inhibitory effects of ESMW on IL-6 and HSL pSer-660, revealing that the antilipolytic and anti-inflammatory activities of ESMW are AMPK dependent. Furthermore, ESMW ameliorated insulin resistance and suppressed lipolysis in HFD-fed mice. It inhibited diacylglycerol accumulation in the liver and inhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis. Conditional medium collected from ESMW-treated 3T3-L1 cells ameliorated insulin action on hepatic gluconeogenesis in liver cells, demonstrating the antilipolytic activity contributed to ESMW beneficial effects on hepatic glucose production. In conclusion, ESMW, as the antilipolytic fraction of SMW, inhibited PKA-HSL related lipolysis by activating AMPK, thus inhibiting diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation in the liver and thereby improving insulin resistance and hepatic gluconeogenesis.

21196758|t|The efficacy and safety of a Chinese herbal product (Xiao-Feng-San) for the treatment of refractory atopic dermatitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
21196758|a|BACKGROUND: Severe and widespread atopic dermatitis often fails to respond adequately to topical steroids and oral antihistamines and requires immunomodulatory drugs which, although effective, have undesirable toxic effects. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 71 patients with severe intractable atopic dermatitis were given an 8-week treatment with oral Xiao-Feng-San (XFS; 47 patients) or placebo (24 patients). Total lesion score, erythema score, surface damage score, pruritus score and sleep score were measured at 4-week intervals. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients completed both the treatment and follow-up periods. The decrease in the total lesion score in the treatment group at 8 weeks was significantly greater than that of the placebo group (79.7 +/- 5.8% vs. 13.5 +/- 7.64%; p < 0.001). There was also a statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo groups with regard to erythema, surface damage, pruritus and sleep scores. The difference between the 2 groups was still significant for all outcome measures except the erythema score at the 12-week follow-up, 4 weeks after the 8-week treatment had ended. Patients reported no side effects from treatment, although some commented on the unpalatability of the medication. CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that the traditional Chinese herbal medicine XFS may be an alternative choice of therapy for severe, refractory, extensive and nonexudative atopic dermatitis.

31407827|t|A randomized controlled, open-label early phase II trial comparing incidence of FOLFIRI.3-induced diarrhoea between Hangeshashinto and oral alkalization in Japanese patients with colorectal cancer.
31407827|a|WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: We conducted a pilot clinical trial to investigate whether Hangeshashinto (TJ-14) could be substituted for oral alkalization in patients scheduled to undergo chemotherapy by FOLFIRI.3 regimen for colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Patients with CRC were randomized 1:1 to a TJ-14 (7.5 g/day) group or an oral alkalization (sodium bicarbonate, 1.8 g/day; ursodeoxycholic acid, 300 mg/day) group. The primary endpoint was incident of late-onset diarrhoea. A total of 30 patients were randomized to either the TJ-14 group or the alkalization group. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There was no statistical difference in age, concomitantly used drugs or UGT1A1 genotypes between the groups. In the alkalization group (n = 15), the frequency of grade 0/1/2 and grade 3 diarrhoea was 73% and 27%, respectively. In the TJ-14 group (n = 14), the frequency of grade 0/1/2 and grade 3 diarrhoea was 79% and 21%, respectively. Grade 4 diarrhoea was not observed in either group. There was no statistically significant difference in other adverse events or in response to FOLFIRI.3 between the groups. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This pilot trial suggests that TJ-14 is a promising alternative treatment option to reduce FOLFIRI.3-induced late-onset diarrhoea, although additional clinical study with a larger number of patients is necessary to confirm these results.

32194408|t|Adjunctive Chinese Herbal Products Therapy Reduces the Risk of Ischemic Stroke Among Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.
32194408|a|We performed a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) and the use of Chinese herbal products (CHP) in combination with western medicine (WM) among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The data were sourced from the registry for beneficiaries, inpatient and ambulatory care claims, and Registry for Catastrophic Illness from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan between 1997 and 2011. Patients, who were newly diagnosed with RA between 1997 and 2010, were classified as the CHP group or non-CHP group depending on the presence of absence the adjunctive use of CHP following a diagnosis of RA. A total of 4,148 RA patients were in both the CHP and non-CHP groups after 1:1 matching. Patients in the CHP group had a significantly lower risk of IS compared to patients in the non-CHP group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.86). In the CHP group, patients who used CHP for more than 30 days had a lower risk of IS than their counterparts (aHR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40-0.91). Gui-Zhi-Shao-Yao-Zhi-Mu-Tang, Shu-Jin-Huo-Xie-Tang, and Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng-Tang might be associated with a lower risk of IS. Finally, the use of CHP in combination with WM was associated with a decreased risk of IS in patients with RA, especially among those who had used CHP for more than 30 days. A further randomized control trial is required to clarify the casual relationship between these results.

METHODS: Fifteen apoE(-/-) mice were randomly divided into the common diet group, the hyperlipidemia group, and the hyperlipidemia +HLJDD treatment group, 5 in each group. Mice in the common diet group were fed with a chow diet. Mice in the hyperlipidemia group were fed with high cholesterol wild diet (WD). Those in the hyperlipidemia +HLJDD treatment group were fed with high cholesterol WD supplemented with HLJDD. All mice were fed for 4 weeks. Five C57BL/6 wild types were recruited as the wild common diet control group. HLJDD was administered to mice in the hyperlipidemia + HLJDD treatment group by gastrogavage at the daily dose of 5 g/kg. Equal volume of purified water was given by gastrogavage to mice in the rest 3 groups. Four weeks later, subtypes of monocytes in the peripheral blood were detected by FACS. HLJDD administered to another 30 SD rats by gastrogavage at the daily dose of 5 g/kg, once for every 12 h for 5 times in total, thereby preparing 5% HLJDD containing serum to intervene the differentiation of in vitro primary bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) and foam cells. The M2 subtype surface receptor CD206 of macrophages and foam cells were detected by FACS. The expression of Nos2 and Arg1 genes were assayed by Real-time PCR. RESULTS: The ratio of inflammatory subset of monocytes (Ly6C(high)) increased in the peripheral blood after ApoE(-/-) mice were fed with high fat diet for 4 weeks. HLJDD significantly decreased the ratio of inflammatory subset of monocytes (P < 0.05). Compared with the vehicle serum, 5% HLJDD containing serum significantly increased differentiation of CD206 + M2 BMDM (P = 0.034). Results of real-time quantitative PCR showed that the expression level of Arg1 mRNA could be up-regulated by HLJDD containing serum (P < 0.05), and that of Nos2 mRNA down-regulated (P = 0.017). ox-LDL induced the differentiation of M2 subtype foam cells from BMDM, and HLJDD containing serum could further elevate the ratio of CD206 + M2 foam cells and increase the Arg1 mRNA expression level (both P < 0.01). HLJDD containing serum could inhibit the inversion of M2 subtype of foam cells to M1 subtype induced by Th1 factors, significantly elevate the Arg1 mRNA expression level, and decrease the Nos2 mRNA expression level (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: HLJDD could lower hyperlipidemia induced inflammatory monocyte subtype ratios in the peripheral blood of ApoE(-/-) mice. HLJDD containing serum promoted in vitro differentiation of M2 macrophages and foam cells. HLJDD attenuated and inhibited the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis induced by hyperlipidemia possibly through regulating the functional differentiation of monocytes, macrophages, and foam cells.

31551774|t|Screening of Antiviral Components of Ma Huang Tang and Investigation on the Ephedra Alkaloids Efficacy on Influenza Virus Type A.
31551774|a|Although Ma Huang Tang (MHT) has long been considered as a classical formula for respiratory infections like influenza, bronchitis and asthma, its chemical ingredients that really exert the main efficacy are still obscure. In this study we aimed to screen its antiviral components and investigate the potential mechanisms. The MDCK cellular research results showed that, among nine predominant ingredients of MHT, L-methylephedrin (LMEP), L-ephedrine (LEP) and D-pseudo- ephedrine (DPEP) significantly inhibited the proliferation of influenza A virus in vitro, and the inhibitory effect at 24 h after the treatment was more obvious than that at 48 h. They also significantly inhibited the mRNA expression levels of related genes in the TLR3, TLR4 and TLR7 signaling pathways, which were accompanied with the down-regulation of TNF-alpha level and the up-regulation of IFN-beta level in the cell supernatant. Therefore, three Ephedra alkaloids exert an antiviral effect in vitro which may be closely related to the inhibition of viral replication and the modulation of inflammatory response. Animal research further indicated, at the 3rd and 7th days after infection, LEP and DPEP significantly attenuated lung injury, decreased lung index, virus load in the lung and the level of IL-1beta in serum, inhibited the mRNA expression levels of TNF-alpha, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, NF-kappaB p65 and RIG-1 as well as the protein expression levels of TLR4, TLR7, MyD88 and NF-kappaB p65 and markedly increased thymus index, the level of IL-10 in serum and the mRNA expression level of IFN-gamma. LEP and DPEP have certain protective effects on the influenza virus-infected mice, which may be associated with their abilities of effectively alleviating lung injury, improving the immunologic function of infected mice and adjusting the host's TLRs and RIG-1 pathways. The overall findings demonstrate that, as effective and inexpensive natural substances, Ephedra alkaloids and MHT may have potential utility in clinical management.

A 82-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of cough, fever, and dyspnea after administration of shakuyakukanzoto for two weeks. Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation tests were negative, but bronchoalveolar lavage showed an increase in lymphocytes with an increased CD4/CD8 ratio. Cessation of the drug improved the patient's clinical and X-ray findings and then he was able to be discharged. He was admitted again for a challenge test. His clinical symptoms and X-ray findings became worse 8 days after re-administration, therefore we diagnosed drug-induced pneumonia caused by Shakuyakukanzoto.

28849026|t|The effect of Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction on simulated weightlessnessinduced muscle atrophy and its mechanisms.
28849026|a|Microgravity has been previously demonstrated to induce skeletal muscle atrophy, loss of muscle force and disorders in myogenesis and metabolism. Current pharmacological strategies exhibit poor efficacy. Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction (BZ) is a wellknown traditional Chinese medicine decoction used for myasthenia gravis. In the present study, its effect on unloading induced muscle atrophy was investigated. The mousetail suspension model was used to simulate weightlessness induced muscle atrophy. The results indicated that BZ could significantly protect muscles from simulated weightlessnessinduced atrophy. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, drugCIPHERCS methods were introduced to predict its potential targets, significantly enriched pathways and biological processes. The results demonstrated that the calcium signaling pathway, citrate cycle, biosynthetic and lipid metabolic process are affected by BZ. Among the targets, nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) is one of the most important proteins involved in myogenesis and metabolism. The results indicated that BZ significantly downregulated NCoR 1 expression, and further induced muscle differentiation and metabolism by regulating NCoR1associated gene expression in vivo and in vitro. In summary, the present study indicated that may be effective in combating weightlessnessinduced muscle atrophy. Combined with bioinformatics, the underlying mechanism for this decoction was investigated, which provided an improved understanding of this decoction.

31226383|t|Dangguibuxue decoction abolishes abnormal accumulation of erythroid progenitor cells induced by melanoma.
31226383|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGIC RELEVANCE: Dangguibuxue decoction (DGBX), is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine that contains two types of materials used to treat anemia. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of DGBX on abolishing erythroid progenitor cell (Ter119(+)CD71(+)) accumulation induced by melanoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: B16/F10 melanoma cells were used to establish transplanted and metastatic melanoma models. DGBX or normal saline were administered intragastrically daily after the models were established. Tumor sizes and metastatic nodules were observed after tumor cell inoculation. To further test the function of DGBX on erythroid progenitor cell (EPC) accumulation and immunosuppressive abilities, the percentage of EPCs in the blood, and spleen were quantified with flow cytometry. The proportion of CD8(+) T cells and related functional mediators, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha,were also quantified with flow cytometry. To further strengthen our in vivo observations, DGBX serum was prepared from the rats three days after DGBX was administered. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was carried out to control the quality of the experiments. B16/F10 melanomacells were cultured with DGBX serum, and proliferation and apoptosis were observed with the CCK8 assay and AnnexinV/7AAD staining, respectively. EPCs were isolated from B16/F10-bearing mice and cultured under erythroid differentiation conditions. EPCs were treated with DGBX serum, and mature red cell proportions and cell denucleations were tested with flow cytometry and Giemsa staining of the cultured EPCs. Flow cytometry and qPCR were used to analyze the effects of DGBX on the expression of key molecules involved in erythroid development and to explore the mechanism by which DGBX relieves abnormal EPC accumulation. RESULTS: DGBX treatments significantly reduced B16 melanoma tumor sizes and metastatic nodules. Most importantly, our study strongly suggested that DGBX could alleviate anemia, and systematically enhance anti-tumor immune responses by reducing abnormal EPC accumulation. Moreover, DGBX serum treatments had no direct effect on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis, but could promote EPCs to differentiate into mature red blood cells, in vitro. Mechanistically, at least in part, DGBX relieved abnormal EPC accumulation by altering the "master switch" transcription factors, Pu.1 and Gata-1. CONCLUSIONS: DGBX significantly alleviates abnormal tumor-induced EPC accumulation, inhibits B16 melanoma progression, and enhances anti-tumor immune responses.

22003531|t|Study on the protective effect of shengmai san (see text) on the myocardium in the type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy model rat.
22003531|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Shengmai San ((see text) Pulse-activating Powder) in protecting myocardium in the rat of the type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) model. METHODS: The DCM rat model was established by combination of insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet with intraperitoneal injection of high dose streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). And these rat models were randomly divided into three groups: a normal group (n = 12,one of them died), a model group (n = 15) and a Shengmai San group (treatment group, n = 15).The damage of the myocardium was assessed by electrocardiogram at the twelfth week after modeling, and the blood glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined; the content of the left cardiac ventricle myocardial collagen was quantified by Masson staining test; the level of myocardial cell apoptosis was detected with TUNEL apoptosis detection kit; the damage extent of the myocardial sub-cellular structures was observed by electron microscopy; the expression levels of cardiac TSP-1 (Thrombospondin-1), TGF-beta1 (Transforming Growth F factor-beta) and TRB-3 (Tribbles homolog 3) proteins were detected by immunohistochemical method; the expression levels of cardiac TSP-1, A-TGF-beta1 and L-TGF-beta1 proteins were detected by Western blotting; and the expression levels of TSP-1 and TRB-3 mRNAs were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides levels in both the model groups and the Shengmai San group were significantly decreased; the myocardial tissue was less damaged and the collagen content was reduced in the Shengmai San group; the myocardial sub-cellular structure was injured to a lesser extent; the expression levels of myocardial TSP-1, TGF-beta1, TRB-3, and TSP-1, A-TGF-beta1, L-TGF-beta1 and chymase were decreased, and the expression levels of TSP-1 mRNA and TRB-3 mRNA were decreased in both the model groups and the Shengmai San group (the latter was better),. CONCLUSION: Shengmai San can inhibit myocardial fibrosis in the rat of diabetic cardiomyopathy, and significantly delay the formation of diabetic cardiomyopathy in hyperglycemia rats through multiple pathways.

METHODS: PubMed, CNKI, Wan Fang database, Cochrane Library and online Clinical Trial Registry were searched up to 26 February 2013 for randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) using WDD as intervention versus Western conventional medicine as control to treat stroke. Clinical outcomes were improvement of the Neurological Functional Deficit Scores (NFDS) and overall therapeutic efficacy rates including rate of cure. Meta-regression analysis using Hedges'g was performed for RCTs with significant heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 22 RCTs of ischemic stroke and 4 RCTs of hemorrhagic stroke, involving 2214 patients (1167 used WDD), met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of the 13 RCTs reporting NFDS improvement favored WDD over the control (mean difference=-3.40, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=[-4.64, -2.15]). Rate of overall therapeutic efficacy (odds ratio [OR]=3.39, 95%CI=[1.81, 6.37]) for hemorrhagic stroke were significantly higher in WDD treated patients than the control subjects. In the 1898 patients with ischemic stroke, WDD medication also achieved higher rates of cure (OR=2.22, 95%CI=[1.66, 2.97]) and overall therapeutic efficacy (OR=3.31, 95%CI=[2.54, 4.31]) than the conventional treatment. CONCLUSIONS: WDD displays benefits on improvement of neurological function and overall therapeutic efficacy in post-stroke patients. TCM such as WDD may serve as a therapeutic tool of dual actions to explore the common mechanisms underlying cerebral hemorrhage and ischemia.

11819866|t|Treatment of rotaviral gastroenteritis with Qiwei Baizhu powder.
11819866|a|AIM: To observe the effects of Qiwei Baizhu Powder (QWBZP) on rotaviral gastroenteritis in children and in animal models. METHODS: Enrolled patients were divided into two groups, and one group was treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS) and the other treated with oral liquid of QWBZP. Neonate mice were orally infected with 50 microL rotavirus suspension (4 X 10(8) PFU/mL) and treated with ORS or oral liquid of QWBZP, respectively. RESULTS: Eighty-three cases of rotaviral gastroenteritis treated with QWBZP revealed a better efficacy than that treated with ORS (X(2)=10.87, P < 0.05). The contents of sodium and glucose as well as number of patients with positive human rotavirus antigen in stool in QWBZP group were all less than that in ORS group. In animal models, QWBZP was found effective in treating rotavirus gastroenteritis in neonate NIH mice, as compared with control groups. In QWBZP group, the mortality of infected mice was decreased by 73.3%, the body weight of infected mice was increased, the contents of sodium and glucose as well as number of mice with positive rotavirus antigen in feces were significantly reduced, and the pathological changes such as damage of small intestinal mucosa and villi were also obviously alleviated. CONCLUSION: QWBZP has effects on improving the absorptive function of small intestine, shortening the duration of diarrhea and rotavirus shedding from stool and alleviating the pathological changes of small intestine induced by rotavirus.

33629564|a|Objective: To investigate the effects of Sini San prescription(SNS) on the proliferation and apoptosis of HepG2 cells and its molecular mechanism. Methods: The morphological changes of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells treated by SNS were observed by inverted microscope. MTT assay was used to detect the inhibitory effect of SNS on cell proliferation. Fluorescence staining and flow cytometry were employed to analyze the effect of SNS on apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Rho123 (Rhodamine 123) staining method was performed to detect the changes of mitochondrial membrane potential, and Western blot was used to evaluate the expression of proteins related to apoptosis. Results: The number of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells were significantly decreased (P0.01) and cells showed typical apoptotic cell morphology after treated with serum contained SNS. The inhibition rate of HepG2 cells was increased with the increase of concentration of serum contained SNS. The number of cells in G1 phase was significantly increased, while G2 phase was decreased after treated with serum contained SNS(P0.05).The apoptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential of HepG2 cells were significantly increased and decreased after treated with serum contained SNS(P0.05). The expression levels of Bax, caspase-3,-9 and cyt-c were significantly increased, while the expression of bcl-2 was decreased in HepG2 cells treated with serum contained SNS(P0.05).Conclusion: Sini San prescription can inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells and induce apoptosis by mitochondrial pathway.

32387236|t|Huai hua san alleviates dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis and modulates colonic microbiota.
32387236|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huai hua san (HHS) is a traditional Chinese herbal formula which is firstly documented in the ancient Chinese classic medical work "Pu Ji Ben Shi Fang" in 1132 AD. It has been widely used in the treatment of lower gastrointestinal disorders such as acute colitis and hematochezia for more than 800 years. However, scientific evidence of the efficacy and the exact mechanism of HHS against colitis has not yet been reported. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to investigate the potential effects of HHS in the alleviation of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and the alteration of colonic microbiota composition and structure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HHS solution was orally administrated to 5% DSS-challenged rats once a day for 8 days. Colitis clinical symptoms of colitis were collected, together with colonic mucosal damage assessed at histomorphometric and ultrastructural levels. The protein levels of inflammatory mediators TNF-alpha and CRP were detected by ELISA. The colonic vascular permeability was evaluated by Evans blue extravasation. Meanwhile, The effects of the HHS therapy on the colonic microbiota were evaluated by analyzing the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene by Illumina sequencing and multivariate statistical methods. RESULTS: Daily oral administration of HHS markedly alleviated DSS-induced colitis, as evidenced by decreased colitis disease activity index (DAI) score, reduced colonic inflammation and normalization of colonic vascular hyperpermeability. Moreover, the 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis demonstrated that HHS treatment during colitis prevented the colitis-associated alteration of colonic microbial community at operational taxonomic unit level, together with the DSS-induced colonic microbiota dysbiosis at taxonomic levels. In addition, HHS therapy reduced colitis-associated high increased ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes to a normal level. CONCLUSION: HHS could attenuate ulcerative colitis and ameliorate gut microbial dysbiosis.

31185267|t|Liuwei Dihuang Pills alleviate the polycystic ovary syndrome with improved insulin sensitivity through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
31185267|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex gynecological endocrine disease commonly occurred in women of childbearing age. The main hallmark of PCOS includes elevated androgen production and insulin resistance (IR). Liuwei Dihuang Pills (LWDH Pills), a commonly prescribed traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely used as a tonic prescription to treat diabetes, female menopause syndrome and other symptoms with'Kidney-Yin' deficiency. It has been reported the effects LWDH pills on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in T2DM treatment. Recent studies have also indicated that the treatment of menopausal syndrome may be associated with the ovarian sexual hormone levels regulated by LWDH pills to alleviate female infertility. However, its potential benefits on PCOS have not been fully elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the alterations of PI3K/Akt pathway in polycystic ovary syndrome-insulin resistance (PCOS-IR) progression induced by letrozole combined with high fat diet (HFD) and then to explore the detailed mechanism of LWDH Pills to alleviate PCOS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The female Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously treated with letrozole (p.o administration at 1mgkg(-1).day(-1)) and HFD for 21 days to establish the PCOS-IR model. Concurrently, metformin (200mgkg(-1).day(-1)) or LWDH Pills was orally administrated (1.2 or 3.6gkg(-1).day(-1)) to intervene disease progression. The ovarian pathology was evaluated by HE (hematoxylin-eosin) staining. The serum sexual hormones, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, testosterone, progesterone and fasting insulin (FINS) were determined by radioimmunoassay. The protein expressions of IRS-1, PI3Kp85alpha, Akt and FoxO1a were analyzed by western blotting, while the mRNA levels of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and Cyp19a1 in ovarian tissue were measured by qPCR. RESULTS: The upregulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 (S307), down-regulated phosphorylation of PI3Kp85alpha, Akt, and FoxO1a were significantly reversed by LWDH Pills (3.6gkg(-1).day(-1)) in PCOS-IR rats with up-regulated mRNA levels of FSHR and Cyp19a1 in ovary. Also, the index of insulin resistance was gradually adjusted to normal by LWDH Pills. The serum levels of FSH, estradiol, progesterone levels were significantly raised while LH, testosterone were reduced. The ovarian polycystic changes were alleviated while the atresia follicles were reduced. CONCLUSION: LWDH Pills therapy obviously improved the ovarian polycystic pathogenesis and regained the development of follicles via upregulating Cyp19a1, alleviated insulin resistance through acting on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These findings have provided scientific evidence for LWDH Pills to treat PCOS.

12723759|t|Effects of goshajinkigan on corneal sensitivity, superficial punctate keratopathy and tear secretion in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
12723759|a|Goshajinkigan (niu-che-shen-qi-wan in Chinese), a traditional herbal medicine, has been used in Japan to treat clinical symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. A double-masked study was performed to evaluate its effects on corneal sensitivity, superficial punctate keratopathy and tear production in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Fifty diabetic patients were randomized into two groups: Group A, in which 25 patients received goshajinkigan orally, 7.5 g/day for 3 months; Group B, in which 25 patients were orally administered placebo, 6.0 g/day for 3 months; and in Group C, 25 non-diabetic subjects were orally administered goshajinkigan, 7.5 g/day for 3 months. Corneal sensitivity was measured with an aesthesiometer. The area of superficial punctate keratopathy was expressed as a fluorescein staining score. Reflex tearing was determined with a Schirmer test without anesthesia goshajinkigan was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Corneal thresholds after treatment with goshajinkigan (2.03 g/mm2) in Group A were significantly lower than those before treatment (2.47 g/mm2). Those in Groups B and C did not change after treatment. Fluorescein staining scores after administration of Goshajinkigan (0.64) in Group A were significantly lower than those before treatment (1.32). Those in Groups B and C did not change after treatment. Schirmer test results after goshajinkigan administration (11.0 mm/5 min) in Group A were significantly higher than those before treatment (9.3 mm/5 min). Those in Groups B and C did not change after treatment. Hemoglobin A1c levels in Groups A, B,and C did not change after treatment. Several components in goshajinkigan were found on high performance liquid chromatography. In conclusion, goshajinkigan improved ocular surface disorders in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

27651785|t|Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials.
27651785|a|OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was performed to systematically assess the efficacy and safety of the Chinese herbal medicine Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction (HGWWD) for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy. DATA SOURCES: Six electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE database, Chinese Biomedical Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database, and the Wanfang Database, were searched on the internet for randomized controlled trials published up until 1 December 2015. The search terms included "Chinese herbal medicine", "diabetic peripheral neuropathy" and "randomized controlled trials" in Chinese and in English. DATA SELECTION: We included randomized controlled trials using HGWWD/modified HGWWD for the treatment group, without restriction for the control group. We assessed literature quality in accordance with the Cochrane Review Handbook. A random or a fixed effects model was used to analyze outcomes using RevMan 5.2 software. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were changes in symptoms and nerve conduction velocities. The secondary outcomes were fasting blood glucose and hemorheological indexes. RESULTS: Sixteen randomized controlled trials, with a total of 1,173 patients, were included. Meta-analysis revealed that the efficacy of HGWWD for diabetic peripheral neuropathy was significantly superior compared with the control treatment (i.e., control group) (risk ratio = 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29-0.46, Z =8.33, P < 0.00001) Compared with the control group, there was an increase in median motor nerve conduction velocity (mean difference (MD) = 3.46, 95%CI: 1.88-5.04, Z = 4.30, P < 0.01) and median sensory nerve conduction velocity (MD = 3.30, 95%CI: 2.04-4.56, Z = 5.14, P < 0.01). There was also an increase in peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (MD = 3.22, 95%CI: 2.45-3.98, Z = 8.21, P < 0.01) and peroneal sensory nerve conduction velocity (MD = 3.05, 95%CI: 2.01-4.09, Z = 5.75, P < 0.01) in the treatment groups. No significant difference in fasting blood glucose was found between the treatment groups and the control groups (MD = -0.12, 95%CI: -0.42-0.19, Z = 0.76, P = 0.45). Plasma viscosity was significantly decreased after treatment (MD = -0.11, 95%CI: -0.21 to -0.02, Z = 2.30, P = 0.02). No significant difference in fibrinogen was detectable (MD = -0.53, 95%CI: -1.28-0.22, Z = 1.38, P = 0.17). Four trials reported that treatment groups experienced no adverse reactions. Adverse events were not mentioned in the other 12 trials. No trial reported the incidence of complications, quality of life outcomes, or health economics. CONCLUSION: HGWWD treatment improves diabetic neurologic symptoms and ameliorates nerve conduction velocities. Our study suggests that HGWWD may have significant therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, the methodological quality of the randomized controlled trials was generally low. Larger and better-designed randomized controlled trials are required to more reliably assess the clinical effectiveness of HGWWD.

35413412|t|Prediction of the mechanism of Dachengqi Decoction treating colorectal cancer based on the analysis method of " into serum components -action target-key pathway".
35413412|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common digestive tract malignant tumor that its morbidity and mortality seriously affect human health. At present, Dachengqi Decoction (DCQ), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been clinically used as an adjuvant therapy for CRC. However, pharmacodynamic substance basis and therapeutic mechanism are still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The main constituents absorbed in the blood and possible active targets after DCQ administration were explored based on the analysis method of "into serum components, action target and key pathway", which may provide reference for the study of the pharmacodynamic material basis and action mechanism of Dachengqi Decoction in the treatment of CRC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on the serum pharmacochemistry of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the prescription prototype ingredients of DCQ in mice serum samples were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry technology (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS(E)). Taking the prototype ingredients absorbed into serum as the research object, the possible targets and key pathways of DCQ in vivo were demonstrated by network pharmacology. Finally, using molecular docking verified the binding activity of prototype components and potential action targets. RESULTS: A total of 46 prototype components of DCQ were identified in mice serum, most of which were derived from flavonoids and anthraquinones in Citrus aurantium L. and Rheum palmatum L. Network pharmacology prediction results indicated that the drug prototype components entering the serum may mainly regulate targets including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), etc. and main pathways such as (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B) PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, advanced glycation end products-receptor for AGE (AGE-RAGE) signaling pathway and IL-17 signaling pathway, etc. Molecular docking showed that the prototype active components had strong binding activity to VEGF, Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (HRAS) and MAPK1. CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidated that most of the direct acting substances of DCQ in vivo were flavonoids and anthraquinones, which may play a role in regulating cell reproduction and apoptosis and inhibiting inflammation, providing a reference for the research of pharmacodynamic material basis and mechanism of DCQ in the treatment of CRC.

23320362|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by Pulsatilla decoction. METHODS: 84 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into ethanol control group, model group, SASP group, Pulsatilla decoction group (further divided into low, middle and high dose group) and zVAD group (n = 12). Intragastric and celiac drug administration were used in each group respectively. The expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1beta in the colons were detected by fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR, Elisa and immunohistochemistry after treatment respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, SASP group, middle and high dose group could treat IBD effectively (P < 0.01), while this effect was restrained in zVAD group (P < 0.05). In the meantime, middle and high dose group could effectively raise the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1beta in the colons (P < 0.05), while this effect was also inhibited in zVAD group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pulsatilla decoction is likely to exert their therapeutic effect by activating NLRP3 inflammasome which further promote the formation of the corresponding inflammation factors such as 1L-18 and IL-1beta.

33545574|t|The effect of compound Da-Cheng-Qi Decoction on the treatment of malignant bowel obstruction with transnasal ileus tube.
33545574|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of compound Da-Cheng-Qi Decoction (CDCQD) on the treatment of malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) with transnasal ileus tube (TIT). METHODS: We observed 30 cases of MBO from July 2018 to August 2019. The patients were divided into the control group (n = 15) and the CDCQD group (n = 15) according to a random number table. All patients were inserted the TIT after admission. Twenty-four hours later, the CDCQD group began to take 100 ml CDCQD twice a day for 7 days. The control group took the plain boiled water instead. Other treatment was the same in the two groups. The waistline reduction, the release time of abdominal pain and distention, recovery of exhaust and defecation time, drainage volume of TIT were observed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Three days after insertion of TIT, the abdominal plain film was re-examined in the two groups. Most of the patients' gas-liquid level disappeared and there was no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). The effective rate of CDCQD group (86.7%) was significantly higher than that of control group (53.3%). The recovery time of exhaust and defecation in the CDCQD group was earlier than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The daily drainage volume of TIT in the CDCQD group was less than that in the control group, especially from the fourth day to the sixth day after insertion of TIT, with a significant difference (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: TIT is an effective treatment for patients with MBO. With the basis of TIT treatment, CDCQD therapy can improve the curative effect of MBO. It can promote intestinal exhaust and defecation and improves the curative effect of palliative treatment of MBO. It is an effective method to assist Tit in the treatment for MBO patients.

34306360|t|Acrid-release and bitter-downbearing therapy and banxia xiexin decoction regulate Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, inhibit proliferation and invasion, and induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.
34306360|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of the acrid-release and bitter-downbearing therapy and Banxia Xiexin Decoction (BXD) in treating gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: BXD was decocted, and serum containing medicine was prepared from rats. The SNU-16 cells were cultured with different concentrations of BXD serum (25, 50, 100 muL/mL). Then, those were treated with BXD and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activator (LiCl) and divided into three groups: Control group, BXD group and BXD+LiCl group. Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was detected by immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR, and western blot. Cell activity, clone formation, invasion, metastasis and apoptosis in each group were examined by MTT, clone formation test, Transwell and flow cytometry. The oxidative stress measures in cells of each group were tested by an oxidative stress kit. RESULTS: With increasing BXD concentration, the clonogenic ability of cells was inhibited. BXD can inhibit cell activity, clone formation, invasion and metastasis, promote oxidative stress, and induce apoptosis. It can also inhibit the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. A Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway activator could partially inhibit the action of BXD. CONCLUSION: BXD participates in GC treatment by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, thus inhibiting GC cell activity and clone formation, promoting oxidative stress, and inducing apoptosis.

27045865|t|The effective components of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction against sepsis evaluated by a lipid A-based affinity biosensor.
27045865|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HJD), the classical recipe for relieving fever and toxicity, has been used for treating sepsis in China for sixteen years. However, the effective components of HJD have not been elucidated until now. Therefore, there is a need to elucidate the effective components of HJD against sepsis on animal models induced by endotoxin (LPS). The affinity force of the effective components of HJD with lipid A was evaluated by a biosensor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lipid A is regarded as the bioactive center of LPS and is always used as a drug target. In order to obtain the effective components of HJD against sepsis, seven fractions from HJD were tested by a biosensor method for assessing the affinity for lipid A. After further separation, the components were isolated from high lipid A-binding fractions and their affinities to lipid A were assessed with the aid of a biosensor. Their activities were then assayed by an in vivo experiment administered through a tail vein injection. The levels of LPS, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 from the blood were found and pathology experiments were performed. RESULTS: Three out of the seven fractions exhibited high lipid A-binding affinities. Berberine, baicalin and geniposide were obtained from the three high lipid A-binding fractions. The animal experiments indicated that the levels of LPS, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the medicated treatment groups were much lower than that of the model group ((**)P<0.01). The medicated treatment groups exhibited stronger protective activities on varying organs in the animal model. CONCLUSIONS: Berberine, baicalin and geniposide could neutralize LPS by binding with lipid A and then reduce the release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha induced by LPS. Furthermore, berberine, baicalin and geniposide exhibited protective activities on varying organs compared to the animal model established by the LPS-induced. These results validate that the components from HJD neutralized LPS and then depressed the release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha induced by LPS. This gives further evidence that HJD would be a suitable treatment for sepsis and protecting vital organs.

32454863|t|The Role of Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction in Prevention of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.
32454863|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of Xuefu Zhuyu decoction on preventing contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: A total of 256 patients undergoing selective PCI for coronary artery disease were consecutively enrolled and randomly divided into two groups: Group A (n = 126) and Group B (n = 130). Before and after PCI, all patients routinely received antiplatelet aggregation therapy, antilipidemic therapy, and hydration therapy. Besides routine therapy, patients in Group B received Xuefu Zhuyu decoction from 3 days before PCI to 3 days after PCI. Serum creatinine (Scr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured, respectively, at baseline (72 h before PCI) and at 24, 48, and 72 h after PCI. RESULTS: Compared with Group A, Group B presented a lower fluctuation of SCr and eGFR (P < 0.01). The incidence of CIN was less in Group B. According to the definition, CIN occurred in 5 patients (2.0%) in the intervention group and 5 (4.0%) in the control group (P=0.167). In terms of oxidative stress, Group B had a lower MDA (P < 0.05), but a higher SOD (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the control group, Xuefu Zhuyu decoction intervention therapy increased the level of SOD and reduced MDA. The Xuefu Zhuyu decoction intervention group presented a higher level of eGFR at 24, 48, and 72 h after PCI in patients with coronary heart disease and a lower level of Scr. The results are propitious to prove that Xuefu Zhuyu decoction might play an antioxidative stress role in the prevention of CIN after PCI.

29464180|t|Lingguizhugan Decoction Protects against High-Fat-Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease by Alleviating Oxidative Stress and Activating Cholesterol Secretion.
29464180|a|BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a leading cause of liver transplantation. Lingguizhugan decoction (LGZG), a classical Chinese herbal formula, has beneficial effects on NAFLD animal models. Our study examined the impact of LGZG on hepatic global transcriptome of high-fat-diet-induced NAFLD rats. METHODS: Three groups of Wistar rats were included: normal, NAFLD model, and LGZG-treated NAFLD groups. Four weeks for the treatment, liver tissues were harvested for RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways were detected on hepatic global transcriptome profile. Real-time PCR validated the regulatory patterns of LGZG on NAFLD rats. RESULTS: DEGs between the NAFLD model and normal groups indicated the elevated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and hedgehog signaling pathways in NAFLD rats. In bile secretion pathway, genes involved in cholesterol secretion were activated by LGZG treatment. Increased expression of antioxidant OSIGN1 and decreased expression of genes (AHR, IRF2BP2, and RASGEF1B) that induce oxidative stress and inflammation were observed in NAFLD rats treated with LGZG. The regulatory patterns of LGZG treatment on these oxidative stress-related genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a "two-hits-targeting" mechanism of LGZG in the treatment for NAFLD: alleviating oxidative stress and activating cholesterol secretion.

35003297|t|Simultaneous Determination of Ten Bioactive Components from Shenling Baizhu San in Rat Plasma by UHPLC-MS/MS: Application to a Comparative Pharmacokinetic Study in Normal and Two Models of Ulcerative Colitis Rats.
35003297|a|Shenling Baizhu San, a traditional formula, has a long history of treating spleen asthenic diarrhea by invigorating the spleen and dispelling dampness in China. A rapid and accurate UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and fully validated for the simultaneous determination of ten active constituents in rat plasma: panaxadiol, ginsenoside Rg1, atractylenolide I, atractylenolide III, pachymic acid, neferine, nuciferine, diosgenin, platycodin D, and isoliquiritigenin. The plasma samples were pretreated by the protein precipitation method with acetonitrile. The analytes and puerarin (internal standard) were determined with high selectivity and sensitivity (LLOQ, 0.31-0.68 ng.mL(-1)) within 10 minutes. The validation parameters, including intra-/interday precisions, accuracy, recovery, matrix effect, and stability, were within acceptable ranges. The validated method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetics study of ten components in normal and two rat models of ulcerative colitis (i.e., spleen deficiency with dampness retention-ulcerative colitis (SDDR-UC) rats and pure-ulcerative colitis (P-UC) rats). The pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly different among the three groups of rats. Overall, the absorption of the components was shown as follows: normal group > SDDR-UC group > P-UC group. The study could provide a scientific basis for further studies on pharmacokinetics and clinical differential application of SDDR-UC and P-UC patients.

20819508|t|Effects of traditional Chinese medicine on intestinal mucosal permeability in early phase of severe acute pancreatitis.
20819508|a|BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine has been used widely for many years in China to treat acute pancreatitis. We have investigated the effects of Dachengqi decoction on intestinal mucosal permeability and outcome in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: Forty patients with sustained SAP that required admission to the surgical intensive care unit were enrolled prospectively in the study. All of these patients were divided randomly into the Dachengqi decoction group (n = 20) and control group (n = 20) on admission. Intestinal permeability was assessed by measuring absorption of two metabolically inert markers, lactulose (L) and mannitol (M), which were administered orally. Serum concentrations of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and the ratio of lactulose to mannitol in urine (L/M) were detected in all patients. RESULTS: Compared with those in the control group, urinary L/M ratio decreased significantly in the Dachengqi decoction group on the 7th day after admission (P = 0.001). Also, serum concentrations of LPS were reduced on the 5th and 7th day after admission (P = 0.006, P = 0.008, respectively). Incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and pancreatic infection was significantly lower in the Dachengqi decoction group compared with those in the control group (P = 0.038,P = 0.025, respectively). CONCLUSION: Dachengqi decoction may promote the recovery of intestinal mucosal permeability and decrease the incidence of MODS and pancreatic infection in patients with SAP.

31746413|t|Sini San ameliorates duodenal mucosal barrier injury and lowgrade inflammation via the CRF pathway in a rat model of functional dyspepsia.
31746413|a|The gutbrain interaction is associated with impaired duodenal mucosal integrity and lowgrade in fl ammation, which have been proven to be important pathological mechanisms of functional dyspepsia (FD). Sini San (SNS) is a classical Chinese medicine used to treat FD, but its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of SNS on duodenal mucosal barrier injury and lowgrade in fl ammation with FD, and to assess its potential molecular mechanisms on the braingut axis. FD rats were established using the iodoacetamide and tailsqueezed methods. The expression of corticotropinreleasing factor (CRF), CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) and CRFR2, were determined by western blot analysis and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition, mast cell (MC) migration was assessed by IHC with an antitryptase antibody, and histamine concentration was quantified using ELISA. The mRNA expression levels of tryptase and proteaseactivated receptor 2 (PAR2) were quantified using reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR, and the protein expression levels of zona occludens protein 1 (ZO1), junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM1), betacatenin and Ecadherin were determined via western blot analysis. It was demonstrated that the expression level of CRF was downregulated in the central nervous system and duodenum following SNS treatment, and that SNS modulated the expression of both CRFR1 and CRFR2. In addition, SNS suppressed MC infiltration and the activity of the tryptase/PAR2 pathway in the duodenum. Furthermore, treatment with SNS restored the normal expression levels of ZO1, JAM1 and betacatenin in FD rats. These findings suggested that the therapeutic effects of SNS on FD were achieved by restoring mucosal barrier integrity and suppressing lowgrade inflammation in the duodenum, which was at least partially mediated via the CRF signaling pathway.

11554610|t|The Chinese medicine Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang inhibited proliferation of hepatoma cell lines by inducing apoptosis via G0/G1 arrest.
11554610|a|Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang (BZYQT), a Chinese herbal medicine, inhibited the proliferation of human hepatoma cell lines (Hep3B, HepG2 and HA22T) dose-dependently. The IC50s of BZYQT on the proliferation of Hep3B, HepG2 and HA22T were 432.5+/-31.8 microg/ml, 455.4+/-24.2 microg/ml, and 2284.3+/-77.2 microg/ml respectively on day 3. However, BZYQT did not significantly inhibit the proliferation of normal human hepatocytes (Chang liver, CCL-13) at the concentration under 5,000 microg/ml. Major compounds of BZYQT, including astragaloside IV, ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg1, saikosaponin a and c, and glycyrrhizin, have been identified. To investigate the key inhibitors of BZYQT. Hep3B cells were treated with BZYQT, individual major compounds of BZYQT, and mixture of major compounds in the same ratio as present in BZYQT. Significant inhibition of proliferation was detected in BZYQT and its major compounds mixture in a comparable level. Not any individual major compound examined could suppress the proliferation of Hep3B cells. This data indicated that there could be synergistic or additive effects of the ingredients in BZYQT. BrdU incorporation, cell cycle analysis and DNA fragmentation assay revealed that BZYQT suppressed the proliferation of hepatoma cells via G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibition of DNA synthesis followed by apoptosis.

33101037|t|The Important Role of Volatile Components From a Traditional Chinese Medicine Dayuan-Yin Against the COVID-19 Pandemic.
33101037|a|Aromatic Chinese herbs have been used to prevent plagues since ancient times. Traditional Chinese medicine has unique advantages in the prevention and treatment of epidemic diseases. According to the traditional Chinese medicine treatment plan in the National COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Seventh Edition) of the National Health Commission, Chinese patent medicines or prescriptions rich in aromatic Chinese herbs are selected for prevention and treatment during the period of medical observation, clinical treatment, and recovery of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Some local health committees or traditional Chinese medicine administrations recommend a variety of other ways of using traditional aromatic Chinese herbs to prevent and cure COVID-19. These involve external fumigation, use of moxibustion, and wearing of sachet. The efficacy of aromatic Chinese herbs plays a decisive role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The unique properties, chemical composition, and mechanism of action of aromatic Chinese herbs are worthy of extensive and in-depth experimental and clinical research. The findings are expected to provide a reference for follow-up treatment of novel coronavirus and the development of corresponding drugs. In 2003, Dayuan-Yin produced excellent results in the treatment of the SARS virus. Individually, 112 confirmed cases were administered this drug between January and April 2003, and more than 93.7% of the patients showed noticeable mitigation of the symptoms, as well as recovery. Dayuan-Yin also was selected as one of the nationally recommended prescriptions for the COVID-19. Based on the national recommendation of Dayuan-Yin prescription, this review discusses the role of volatile components in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, and speculates the possible mechanism of action, so as to provide a basis for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

25185358|t|Xuefuzhuyu decoction for hyperlipidemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trails.
25185358|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Xuefuzhuyu decoction for hyperlipidemia. METHODS: Randomized clinical trials on hyperlipidemia treated by Xuefuzhuyu decoction, either alone or with Western Medicine, were searched in electronic databases. Databases searched were: MEDLINE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library 2013 (Issue 4), China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Wanfang Database up to 2 May, 2013. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analysis were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. RESULTS: Six randomized clinical trials involving 748 patients (373 patients in the treatment group, 375 patients in the control group) were included in the analysis. The studies were of low methodological quality. Meta-analysis indicated that the effect of Xuefuzhuyu decoction on hyperlipidemia was better than that in the control group [n = 748, OR = 5.07, 95% CI (3.40, 7.58), P < 0.01]. Weighted mean differences in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were - 0.79, - 0.74, - 0.44, 0.16, respectively, and Meta-analysis revealed that the treatment group was better than the control group with 95% CI (- 1.21, - 0.36),(- 0.94, - 0.55), (- 0.77, - 0.11), (0.04, 0.27), respectively (all P < 0.05). Some adverse events in evaluated studies were recorded. CONCLUSION: Xuefuzhuyu decoction may be effective for treating hyperlipidemia. The studies we analyzed were of low methodological quality, which indicates that the above findings should be considered cautiously. Therefore, more strictly designed large-scale randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of Xuefuzhuyu decoction in hyperlipidemia.

25610480|t|Da-bu-yin-wan and qian-zheng-san to neuroprotect the mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
25610480|a|Da-Bu-Yin-Wan (DBYW) and Qian-Zheng-San (QZS), two classic traditional Chinese medicinal formulas, were clinically employed to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). Our previous studies demonstrated neuroprotective effects of them on mitochondrial function in PD mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The purpose of this research was to investigate their possible mechanisms in the light of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mitoKATP) channels. The neuroprotective effect of DBYW and QZS on dopamine (DA) neurons in substantia nigra (SN) in the MPTP-induced PD mice was investigated by behavioral test (pole test) and immunohistochemistry. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the midbrain tissue was detected by firefly luciferase method. MitoKATP channel subunits SUR1 and Kir6.2 mRNA and protein expressions were tested by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot. It was observed that DBYW and/or QZS served to ameliorate MPTP-induced behavioral impairment and prevent the loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons, as well as increase ATP level in the midbrain tissue and downregulate SUR1 expression at mRNA and protein levels with no marked influence on Kir6.2. We concluded that DBYW and QZS exhibit neuroprotective effects probably through the regulation of ATP level and mitoKATP channel subunit expressions.

24778699|t|Alleviative Effects of a Kampo (a Japanese Herbal) Medicine "Maoto (Ma-Huang-Tang)" on the Early Phase of Influenza Virus Infection and Its Possible Mode of Action.
24778699|a|A Kampo medicine, maoto, has been prescribed in an early phase of influenza-like illness and used for a treatment of influenza clinically in Japan these days. However, the efficacy of maoto against the virus infection remains to be elucidated. This study was conducted to evaluate the alleviative effects of maoto against early phase of influenza virus infection and its preliminary mode of actions through immune systems. When maoto (0.9 and 1.6 g/kg/day) was orally administered to A/J mice on upper respiratory tract infection of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 from 4 hours to 52 hours postinfection (p.i.) significant antipyretic effect was shown in comparison with water-treated control. Administration of maoto (0.8 and 1.3 g/kg/day) significantly decreased the virus titers in both nasal (NLF) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) at 52 hours p.i., and significantly increased the anti-influenza virus IgM, IgA, and IgG1 antibody titers in NLF, BALF, and serum, respectively. Maoto also increased significantly the influenza virus-bound IgG1 and IgM antibody titers in serum and the virus-bound IgM antibody titer in even the BALF of uninfected A/J mice. These results indicate that maoto exerts antipyretic activity in influenza virus-infected mice and virus reducing effect at an early phase of the infection through probably augmentation of the virus-bound natural antibodies.

16705860|t|Effects of Chinese herbal medicine based on hachimi-jio-gan on osteopenia in rats.
16705860|a|The effects of Chinese herbal medicines including Hachimi-jio-gan (HJG) and/or Hochu-ekki-to (HEW) on osteopenia in rats were investigated. The Chinese herbal medicines were administrated for 8 weeks (7 times/week) starting from 1 week after ovariectomy. HJG and Prescription-2 (Prsc-2, the prescription based on HJG) showed protective effect on bone loss of the vertebrae after ovariectomy. However, Prescription-1 (the prescription based on HJG and HET) had no effect. Then, we made osteopenia model in rats by prednisolone and low calcium diet. Prsc-2 and HJG were administrated for 20 weeks with prednisolone. These Chinese remedies showed protective effects for osteopenia, with better indices on bone loss of the limbs than HJG alone in the osteopenia rats. It can be concluded that Prsc-2 is more effective than HJG for bone loss induced by various factors, and the additives in Prsc-2 may enhance the therapeutic effect.

32632716|t|Mechanism of cAMP-PKA Signaling Pathway Mediated by Shaoyao Gancao Decoction () on Regulation of Aquaporin 5 and Muscarinic Receptor 3 Levels in Sjogren's Syndrome.
32632716|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of cAMP-PKA signaling pathway mediated by Chinese medicine formula Shaoyao Gancao Decoction (, SGD) on the regulation of aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and muscarinic receptor 3 (M3R) levels in Sjogren's syndrome (SS). METHODS: Of the 30 mice, 5 were randomly selected as control, and others were used for creating SS model. After successful modeling, mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=5 per group) and intragastrically administered with saline (8 mL/kg), pilocarpine (1.4 mg/kg), or low, medium and high doses SGD (0.14, 0.21, 0.35 g/kg Radix paeoniae with 0.01 g/kg Radix glycyrrhizae, respectively) for 6 weeks. Human labial gland acinar cells were treated with pilocarpine or varying doses of SGD with saline as the placebo. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological changes of the submandibular glands of mice. The serum levels of anti-SS antigen A (SS-A), anti-SS antigen B (SS-B), M3R, and alpha-fodrin in submandibular glands of mice were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunofluorescence staining was used to observe the spatial localization of AQP5 and M3R in acinar cells. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to detect the expressions of PKA, cAMP, Epac1, AQP5, M3R, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in submandibular gland tissues and cells of each group. RESULTS: Compared to normal mice, body weight, 5-min salivary secretion, 30-min secretion of tears and breakup time of tear film of model mice decreased at 1-6 weeks after immunization (all P<0.05), whereas water intake increased (all P<0.05). In the model group, glands of the submandibular glands showed atrophy, accompanied by acini of different sizes, decreased numbers and loose arrangement, with catheter dilatation and different degrees of lymphocyte infiltration. Conditions of mice in SGD groups were improved. The positive expression of AQP5 and M3R were higher in the acinar cells treated with all doses SGD compared to the normal group; serum levels of SS-A, SS-B, and alpha-fodrin were lower, and that of M3R was higher in all doses SGD treated animals than the model or pilocarpine treated ones (all P<0.05). Compared to the model and pilocarpine groups, the mRNA and protein levels of NF-kappaB and TNF-alpha were lower in mice or cells treated with medium or high-dose SGD (all P<0.05), while those of PKA, Epac1, AQP5 and M3R were higher (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: SGD can improve symptoms of SS by regulating the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and increasing AQP5 and M3R levels.

16503526|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of Buyanghuanwu decoction (BYHWD) in inducing nerve proliferation in rats with sequelae of ischemic stroke. METHODS: A rat model of ischemic stroke sequelae was established by means of craniectomy in which the right common carotid artery was ligated with 4-0 silk thread followed by cauterization of the right middle cerebral artery. Programmed electric shock was administered 24 h after the onset of ischemic stroke for 2 h daily for 20 consecutive days. The rats in sham operation group were not subjected to ligation of the right common carotid artery or right middle cerebral artery occlusion. The rats in the treatment groups were given oral BYHWD for 15 consecutive days. All the rats received repeated intraperitoneal injections of the cell proliferation-specific marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and the intake of BrdU in the cerebral tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The number of BrdU-immunoreactive cells in the cerebral tissues of BYHWD-treated rats was significantly greater than that in the untreated model group. CONCLUSION: BYHWD can promote nerve proliferation in rats with ischemic stroke sequelae.

35378193|t|Systems pharmacology, proteomics and in vivo studies identification of mechanisms of cerebral ischemia injury amelioration by Huanglian Jiedu Decoction.
35378193|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HLJDD) has the effect of clearing heat and detoxifying, and has been considered as an effective prescription for cerebral ischemia (CI) for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It can improve the quality of life of patients with ischemic stroke, but its pharmacological mechanism remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aimed to explore the pharmacological action and potential mechanism of HLJDD against CI by systems pharmacology, proteomics and in vivo experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, databases such as TCMIP V2.0 and Genecards were used to predict compounds, targets and CI related targets, and network topology criteria of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was used to screen core targets. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery database (DAVID) was used to discover biological processes and pathways. In addition, molecular docking was performed between the screened core biological active compounds and targets to verify the binding activity. Finally, proteomics and Western blot were performed on cerebral cortex tissues of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rats with HLJDD intervention to further verify the predicted results. RESULTS: 77 compounds and 308 targets of HLJDD were identified, 54 of which were predicted to be associated with cerebral ischemia. PPI network and enrichment results showed that 8 targets, including AKT1, PTGS2 and TLR4, were core targets of HLJDD in CI. And 19 signaling pathways, including Rap1 signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway and arachidonic acid metabolism, were identified as key pathways to the therapeutic activity of HLJDD in CI. Combined with proteomics studies, we identified that Rap1 signaling pathway and upstream and downstream targets were the key mechanisms. Molecular biology experiments showed that RAP1A and AKT expression levels were significantly up-regulated in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats treated with HLJDD (P < 0.0001), GRIN1 expression level was significantly down-regulated (P < 0.0001). However, ACTB expression level was slightly down-regulated (P > 0.05), which may be related to the biological function. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the pharmacological effect of HLJDD on cerebral ischemia. These results indicate that HLJDD mediates various pathways such as inhibition of apoptosis, regulation of oxygen balance, inhibition of excitatory toxicity and maintenance of basic cell functions to improve CI by regulating Rap1 signaling pathway.

29474901|t|Arachidonic acid metabonomics study for understanding therapeutic mechanism of Huo Luo Xiao Ling Dan on rat model of rheumatoid arthritis.
29474901|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huo Luo Xiao Ling Dan (HLXLD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the potential therapeutic mechanism of HLXLD on anti-inflammatory activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A metabolomic approach based on UFLC-MS/MS to profile arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic changes was used. The cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) catalyzed metabolites in plasma were quantified on 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after the rats injected with Complete Freund's adjuvant and orally administrated with HLXLD, methotrexate and dexamethasone in parallel as the positive control drugs. RESULTS: Nineteen metabolites involved in COX and LOX pathways in RA model group were significant increased compared with normal group (P<0.05), including 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), 15-HETE, 8-HETE, leukotriene B4(LTB4), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGI2, PGD2, PGF2alpha, thromboxane B2 (TXB2), etc. From day 7 to day 28, the trajectory direction of HLXLD group and positive control groups gradually moved towards the initial space, and the concentrations of AA and its metabolites after HLXLD treatment were significantly reduced in dual pathways compared to control groups. CONCLUSION: HLXLD induced a substantial change in the AA metabolic profiles through refrain the expression of COX and LOX. The present investigation also highlights that distinct ingredients of this formula tend to inhibit different target to achieve a therapeutic effect.

26488619|t|The metabolomic study on atherosclerosis mice and its application in a traditional Chinese medicine Sishen granule.
26488619|a|Although an atherosclerosis (AS) model using low-density lipoprotein receptor deletion mice has been widely applied, its pathological pathway in metabolite level is still not clear. To further reveal the metabolite profile and identify the potential biomarkers in AS development, a serum metabolomic approach was developed based on reversed-phase liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS). The established metabolomic platform was also used for elucidating the therapeutic mechanism of a traditional Chinese medicine named Sishen granule (SSKL). Twenty-one potential biomarkers in AS mouse serum were identified. Through functional analysis of these biomarkers, inflammation, proliferation, dysfunction of energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism were considered the most relevant pathological changes in AS. DNA damage products were found for the first time in the metabolomic study of AS. The network established by 20 biomarkers revealed that pyruvate metabolism, citrate cycle, fatty acid metabolism and urea metabolism were seriously disturbed. This metabolomic study not only supplied a systematic view of the progression of AS but also provided a theoretical basis for the treatment of AS. This metabolomic study also demonstrated that SSKL had therapeutic effectiveness for AS through partly reversing the inflammation reaction and amino acid metabolism dysfunction.

33054436|t|Chemical composition and pharmacological mechanism of shenfu decoction in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).
33054436|a|PURPOSE: Shenfu decoction has outstanding curative effects in the treatment of COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the material basis and molecular mechanism of Shenfu Decoction through network pharmacology and molecular mechanisms, to provide a research basis for clinical medication and clues for subsequent research. METHODS: The active components and targets of Shenfu decoction were searched in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), and the COVID-19-associated genes were collected using the Gene Cards platform. The target protein-protein interaction network map was constructed by mapping two genes, and the 'drug-active ingredient-target' network was constructed using Cytoscape software. The Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of the mapping targets were analyzed. RESULT: Based on Traditional Chinese medicine, Shenfu Decoction can take effect in the lung, spleen, kidney and heart. Considering oral bioavailability (OB) >/= 30% and drug-like (DL) >/= 0.18 as the standard, 43 active compounds were screened and 114 Shenfu decoction action targets were collected. The key targets were CASP3, MAPK8, PTGS2, IL1B, PPARG, ICAM1, IFNG, RELA, NOS2, NOS3, HMOX1, CASP8, STAT1, and TGFB1. According to the standard of p < .05, GO function was enriched in 108 biological processes, 16 cell processes and 27 molecular processes. Sixty-three signaling pathways were enriched by KEGG, which can be divided into four types: viral infection pathways, signal pathways, biological process pathways and different disease pathways. The comparison of negative and positive prescriptions further reflects the positive effect of Shenfu decoction against COVID-19. Finally, the effective ingredients with the high degree were molecular docked with Mpro, Rdrp and Spro proteins to further confirm the intervention effect of Shenfu Decoction on COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Shenfu decoction played an important role in regulating the anti-virus process, regulating immunity, inhibiting inflammation and regulating apoptosis through the interrelated regulation mechanism of multi-components and multi-targets, to treat patients with severe COVID-19.

33023593|t|Uncovering the protective mechanism of Taohong Siwu decoction against diabetic retinopathy via HIF-1 signaling pathway based on network analysis and experimental validation.
33023593|a|BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common and serious microvascular complication of diabetes. Taohong Siwu decoction (THSWD), a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription, has been proved to have a good clinical effect on DR, whereas its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Our study aimed to uncover the core targets and signaling pathways of THSWD against DR. METHODS: First, the active ingredients of THSWD were searched from Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) Database. Second, the targets of active ingredients were identified from ChemMapper and PharmMapper databases. Third, DR associated targets were searched from DisGeNET, DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database (TTD). Subsequently, the common targets of active ingredients and DR were found and analyzed in STRING database. DAVID database and ClueGo plug-in software were used to carry out the gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analysis. The core signaling pathway network of "herb-ingredient-target" was constructed by the Cytoscape software. Finally, the key genes of THSWD against DR were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 2340 targets of 61 active ingredients in THSWD were obtained. Simultaneously, a total of 263 DR-associated targets were also obtained. Then, 67 common targets were found by overlapping them, and 23 core targets were identified from protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Response to hypoxia was found as the top GO term of biological process, and HIF-1 signaling pathway was found as the top KEGG pathway. Among the key genes in HIF-1 pathway, the mRNA expression levels of VEGFA, SERPINE1 and NOS2 were significantly down-regulated by THSWD (P < 0.05), and NOS3 and HMOX1 were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: THSWD had a protective effect on DR via regulating HIF-1 signaling pathway and other important pathways. This study might provide a theoretical basis for the application of THSWD and the development of new drugs for the treatment of DR.

21660310|t|Suan zao ren tang as an original treatment for sleep difficulty in climacteric women: a prospective clinical observation.
21660310|a|Little scientific evidence supports the efficacy of herbal medicines in the treatment of women with sleep difficulty during the climacteric period. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Suan Zao Ren Tang (SZRT) in reducing the impact of sleep disturbance on climacteric women, as measured by Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI) and the World Health Organization quality of life (WHOQOL). Sixty-seven climacteric women with sleep difficulty intending to treat received SZRT at a rate of 4.0 g, thrice daily for four weeks (MRS < 16, n = 34; MRS >/= 16, n = 33). After taking into account potential confounding factors, the mean PSQI total scores had fallen from 13.0 (+/-2.9) to 9.0 (+/-3.2) (95% confidence interval -4.93, -3.10). Further analyses showed that SZRT produced superior benefit of daytime dysfunction in women with severe menopausal symptoms (MRS >/= 16). There were three of the withdrawals involved treatment-related adverse events (stomachache, diarrhea, and dizziness). Excluding women with a past history of stomachache, diarrhea, or dizziness, four weeks of therapy with SZRT appears to be a relatively safe and effective short-term therapeutic option in improving daytime function of climacteric women with poor sleep quality.

2060051|a|Da Cheng Qi Tang (DCQT) is a classical prescription of Chinese medicine for treatment of acute intestinal obstruction. In this paper, the isolated colon smooth muscle from normal and experimental colon obstruction (CO) rats were used to study the effect of DCQT on 45Ca content. The results showed that the 45Ca content on isolated colon smooth muscle (microns/g wet tissue, mean +/- S) was 0.043 +/- 0.009 in the normal and 0.057 +/- 0.012 in those treated by DCQT respectively. The content of 45Ca in CO was higher than the normal, DCQT can reduce the content of 45Ca in CO. It is known that the higher level of intracellular CA++ is related to the formation and the development of acute intestinal obstruction. The inhibitory effect of DCQT on 45Ca content may play an important role in the treatment of acute colon obstruction.

34934326|t|A Comparison of the Risk of Fracture in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients with and without Receiving Chinese Herbal Medicine.
34934326|a|OBJECTIVE: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often suffer from bone complications due to persistent joint inflammation, especially incident fracture. Nowadays, Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have provided safe and effective therapy for treating skeletal conditions, but it is unclear whether CHMs can prevent fracture onset among RA individuals. This study aimed to determine the association between the use of CHMs and the risk of fracture among them. METHODS: This retrospective, population-based study retrieved administrative health data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) database to identify patients with newly diagnosed RA between 2000 and 2009. Of the 6178 incident RA patients, 2495 matched pairs of CHMs users and non-CHMs users were identified by propensity score matching. Enrollees with hip fractures prior to RA onset were excluded. Included subjects were followed until the end of 2013. Incidence and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of new-onset bone fracture in the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model were measured with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Fracture incidence was lower in CHMs users than in the comparison cohort (26.91 vs 32.94 per 1000 person-years, respectively), with an adjusted HR of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92). Subjects receiving CHMs for more than 2 years had a much lower risk of fracture onset by more than 50%. Some CHMs prescriptions (Yan Hu Suo, Bei Mu, Da Huang, Dang Shen, Fu-Zi, Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang, Dang-Gui-Nian-Tong-Tang, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, Gan-Lu-Yin, and Gui-Zhi-Shao-Yao-Zhi-Mu-Tang) were associated with reduced fracture risk. CONCLUSION: Adding CHMs to routine treatment was found to be related to lower fracture risk in RA patients.

31252309|t|Metabolomics coupled with integrative pharmacology reveal the protective effect of FangjiHuangqi Decoction against adriamycin-induced rat nephropathy model.
31252309|a|With the development of the society, the number of people who got the nephrotic syndrome (NS) is going up roughly. Therefore, finding a better way to treat NS is becoming a major global public health issue. As we all know, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), especially Fangji Huangqi Decoction (FHD), has a long history and has good curative effects on NS. However, the mechanism of FHD treating NS has not been clearly elucidated. To address this problem, a feasible system was developed by metabolomics and integrative pharmacology approach. To study the mechanisms of Chinese medical formula FHD treating NS based on metabolomics and integrative pharmacology. In this study, a NMR based metabolomics approach coupled with biochemical assay and Western Blot had been employed to study the protective effect of FHD against adriamycin-induced nephropathy using rat model. And we proposed a integrative pharmacology-based method, which combined chemical ingredients database building, target identification and network analysis. These were aimed to decipher the mechanisms of action for the FHD in NS treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed that 13 of 16 perturbed metabolites could be reversed by FHD, and the MetaboAnalyst analysis revealed that the anti-nephrotic syndrome effect of FHD was probably related with regulation of alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, citrate cycle, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. The integrative pharmacology analysis revealed 93 potential targets for FHD, and suggested that the protective effect of FHD on the nephrotic syndrome was probably related with the regulation of immune, and energy metabolic and fatty acid metabolic. In addition, both the metabolomics and the integrative pharmacology are focus together on the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathway. These metabolites changes and the core targets changes, as well as the metabolite-target pathway network provide insights into the mechanisms of FHD treating nephrotic syndrome, and further studies are needed to validate the bioactive compounds responsible for the anti-nephrotic syndrome effect of FHD.

25920537|t|Effects of Dachengqi Decoction () on morphological changes in enteric nerve system of rats with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
25920537|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the morphological changes in enteric nerve system (ENS) of rats with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) treated by Dachengqi Decoction (, DCQD). METHODS: Fifty Wistar rats were randomly assigned to the control group, MODS model group and DCQD treated group. The rats in MODS model group and DCQD treated group were injected Escherichia coli (E. coli) suspension into abdominal cavity under sterile condition. The DCQD treated group was gavaged with DCQD 2 days before the E. coli suspension was injected. Twenty-four hours after injection, the proximal segment of intestine was resected and studied by immunohistofluorescence using vesicular acetylcholine transporter, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), substance P (SP) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) antibodies. The whole-mount preparations were observed by laser scanning confocal microscope to detect the changes of quantity and fluorescence integral optical density (IOD) value of intestine enteric nerves. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the quantity and IOD value of acetylcholine (ACh), VIP, SP and nitric oxide (NO) nerves of intestine in the MODS group were significantly decreased (P<0.01), and the network of enteric nerves was remarkably disrupted. Compared with the MODS group, the quantity and fluorescence IOD value of ACh, VIP, SP and NO nerves in the DCQD group were significantly increased (P<0.01), and the network of enteric nerves was remarkably recovered. CONCLUSION: DCQD can protect and repair damage in the network of ACh, SP, NO and VIP nerves in rats with MODS, which may be one of mechanisms involved in promoting gastrointestinal motility by DCQD.

34428523|t|The efficacy and safety of Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction combined with Mifepristone in the treatment of uterine leiomyoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
34428523|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Uterine leiomyoma (UL) is a common severe gynecological issue. In China, Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction (XFZYD), combined with Mifepristone, is widely used in the treatment of UL. However, their combined effectiveness and safety for this purpose have not yet been explored. AIM OF THE STUDY: This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of XFZYD combined with Mifepristone as a method of treatment for UL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the following 7 databases: 3 English medical databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), and 4 Chinese medical databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and the Wanfang database). The primary outcome was the effect of XFZYD combined with Mifepristone on the effective rate, uterine leiomyoma volume (ULV), and uterine volume (UV) of uterine leiomyoma. Bias risk was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The software RevMan5 was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies and process the data. RESULTS: The 11 studies included in this systematic review were all undertaken in China, with a total of 902 participants. The meta-analysis of XFZYD combined with Mifepristone compared with Mifepristone alone showed that the effective rate (RR 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-1.27, P < 0.00001), ULV (SMD -1.60, 95% CI: 2.11 to -1.08, P < 0.00001), and UV (SMD -1.65, 95% CI: 1.85 to -1.44, P < 0.00001) in the primary outcomes, and estradiol (E2) (MD -51.81, 95% CI: 69.68 to -33.94, P < 0.00001), luteinizing hormone (LH) (MD -3.09, 95% CI: 3.58 to -2.60, P < 0.00001), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (MD -1.09, 95% CI: 1.86 to -0.31, P = 0.006), progesterone (P) (MD -3.55, 95% CI: 4.54 to -2.55, P < 0.00001), and adverse events (RR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.34-0.89), P = 0.01) in the secondary outcomes were significantly reduced, and the data were statistically significant. The subgroups of ULV, E2, and FSH showed that the treatment time might not have been the heterogeneous source of ULV and FSH, but was the heterogeneous source of E2. Sensitivity analysis was carried out on the 3 outcome indicators, and the results were relatively stable after excluding one reference for each indicator. CONCLUSION: There is some encouraging evidence that the combination of XFZYD and Mifepristone can benefit patients by treating UL. However, because of research shortcomings such as lacking allocation concealment and blindness, this study's results should be treated with caution. In order to verify the advantages of this method, it is necessary to carry out further large-scale randomized controlled trials.

30327678|t|Mechanisms of Zuogui Pill in Treating Osteoporosis: Perspective from Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells.
30327678|a|The current treatment strategies for osteoporosis (OP) involve promoting osteogenic differentiation and inhibiting adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). According to a theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the kidneys contain an "essence" that regulate bone metabolism and generate marrow. Kidney disorders are therefore considered to be a major cause of OP as per the principles of TCM, which recommends kidney-tonifying treatments for OP. The Zuogui pill (ZGP) is a classic kidney-tonifying medication that effectively improves OP symptoms. Studies have shown that ZGP can promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, providing scientific evidence for the TCM theory linking kidneys with bone metabolism. In this review, we have provided an overview of recent studies that examined the underlying mechanisms of ZGP mediated regulation of BMSC osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation.

The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and Barthel index (BI) were assessed before treatment and at 4-week intervals. RESULTS: We observed that the FMA score and BI were increased, in both groups at week 4, 8 and 12 compared with the baseline. Furthermore, significantly better FMA score was observed in patients treated with DHYZ at week 8 and 12 (both P<0.05). BI was significantly higher in DHYZ group than in placebo group at weeks 12 (P<0.05). At week 12, the 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) of mean difference of FMA and BI also indicated that the differences between two groups were statistically significant. Compared to placebo, DHYZ produced significantly greater improvement in FMA grade at week 12 (44.4% versus 23.8%, chi(2)=4.09, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DHYZ showed good efficacy, safety and tolerability in patients affected by ischemic stroke. We conclude that DHYZ may be a useful therapeutic option in patients with ischemic stroke.

34728317|t|The mechanism of action of Fangji Huangqi Decoction on epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer using high-throughput next-generation sequencing and network pharmacology.
34728317|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Fangji Huangqi Decoction (FHD) is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). FHD has been hypothesized to inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which may positively impact breast cancer prevention and treatment. However, its exact mechanism of action is still unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to screen potential targets of FHD for the treatment of EMT in breast cancer through network pharmacology, and to verify their therapeutic effects in vitro experiments and high-throughput second-generation sequencing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data sets of effective components and targets of FHD were established through the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database. The GeneCards and OMIM databases were used to establish breast cancer-related target datasets, which were then matched with the TCM target data. The interaction between key target proteins was analyzed using the STRING database; the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were used to identify the associated biological processes and enriched signal pathways, respectively. The active ingredient disease target network was analyzed using Cytoscape. Finally, next generation sequencing was used to verify the related pathways of FHD intervention in EMT in breast cancer. High-content screening was used to identify the genes/pathways affected by FHD. MDA-MB-231 and HCC-1937 breast cancer cell lines were used to evaluate the impact of FHD on migration, invasion, and EMT. RESULTS: Eighty possible significant targets were identified for the treatment of breast cancer EMT with FHD; GO and KEGG were used to identify 173 cell biological processes associated with breast cancer (P < 0.05), including the NF-kappaB and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. The high-throughput sequencing and network pharmacology results were highly consistent. The migration and invasion ability of MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced and their EMT status could be reversed by DSHR2 knockdown. The results of morphology and scratch assays showed that FHD could improve the EMT status of HCC-1973. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides more evidence to support the clinical application of FHD, which has reliable interventional effects on breast cancer EMT. Its therapeutic effects may involve a multi-target, multi-pathway, and multi-mechanism effect.

24239600|t|A traditional herbal formula, Hyangsa-Pyeongwi san (HPS), improves quality of life (QoL) of the patient with functional dyspepsia (FD): randomized double-blinded controlled trial.
24239600|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hyangaa-Pyeongwi san is the most well known description in Traditional Chinese Medicine for treating functional gastrointestinal disorders. Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a main concern of intimidating quality of life (QoL) in recent days. Although many medicines have been developed to improve FD symptoms as well as QoL, there are no potential drugs and treatments for FD. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Hyangaa-Pyeongwi san (HPS) on QoL of patients with FD. METHODS: This study was designed as a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, and parallel group trial. Participants received either placebo or HPS (9.68g of HPS at once, three times daily) for 4-weeks, and the efficacy evaluations were performed by assessing the Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) and functional dyspepsia-quality of life (FD-QoL) at 0-, 4- and 8-weeks. RESULTS: Total of 170 patients participated and were randomly allocated into placebo or HPS groups. Total symptom score of NDI decreased after 4-weeks trial in both groups (p>0.05). HPS significantly improved QoL scores, especially in the area of 'interference and eat/drink' in NDI (p=0.0031) as well as 'liveliness status', 'role-functioning status', and total score in FD-QoL (p=0.026 for liveliness status and p=0.035 for role-functioning status). This significant improvement of FD-QoL had lasted for 4-weeks. CONCLUSION: HPS treatment is markedly effective in improving QoL in patients with FD. Moreover, we observed that this improvement had lasted for 4 weeks after finishing the trial through the follow-up study.

22675381|t|The Immunomodulatory Effect of You-Gui-Wan on Dermatogoides-pteronyssinus-Induced Asthma.
22675381|a|The traditional Chinese medicine You-Gui-Wan (YGW) contains ten species of medicinal plants and has been used to improve health in remissive states of asthma for hundreds of years in Asia. However, little is known about the immunomodulatory mechanisms in vivo. Therefore, this study investigated the pathologic and immunologic responses to YGW in mice that had been repeatedly exposed to Dermatogoides-pteronyssinus (Der p). YGW reduced Der-p-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and total IgE in serum. It also inhibited eosinophil infiltration by downregulating the protein expression of IL-5 in serum and changed the Th2-bios in BALF by upregulating IL-12. Results of the collagen assay and histopathologic examination showed that YGW reduced airway remodeling in the lung. In addition, after YGW treatment there was a relative decrease in mRNA expression of TGF-beta1, IL-13, eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-1 in lung in the YGW group. The results of EMSA and immunohistochemistry revealed that YGW inhibited NF-kappaB expression in epithelial lung cells. YGW exerts its regulative effects in chronic allergic asthmatic mice via its anti-inflammatory activity and by inhibiting the progression of airway remodeling.

7474502|t|Apoptosis of HIV-infected cells following treatment with Sho-Saiko-to and its components.
7474502|a|Baicalein and baicalin are components of Sho-saiko-to (SST), a Chinese medical drug which is claimed to be therapeutically effective in treating HIV-infected patients. Although 20 micrograms/ml of baicalin was not cytotoxic to CEM cells, a cultured T cell line, it proved to be cytotoxic to HIV-infected CEM cells (CEM-HIV) with a higher HIV-releasing capacity and DNA fragmentation was detected within 24 hr of incubation. However, after incubation of CEM-HIV with a lower dose of baicalin (0.1, 0.3 and 2 micrograms/ml) for 24 and 48 hr, the viable cell number increased by about 25% and the p24 release into the medium was 25% lower than that of the control. After further incubation in the presence of the agent for 6 and 9 days, only cells with a lower HIV-releasing capacity survived. Baicalin might selectively induce apoptosis of CEM-HIV cells which have a high virus-releasing capacity, and stimulate proliferation of CEM-HIV which have a relatively lower capacity of HIV-production.

33350270|t|[Effect of Xiaoyao San on OVX combined with CUS anxiety and depression model rats based on hippocampal microglia M1 polarization].
33350270|a|To investigate the anti-anxiety and anti-depression effect and mechanism of Xiaoyao San on rats with ovariectomy(OVX) combined with chronic unpredictable stress(CUS) model. The model of perimenopausal depression was established by OVX and CUS; the level of anxiety and depression was evaluated by open field test; the levels of interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta) and interleukin-6(IL-6) mRNA in rat hippocampus were detected by Real-time qPCR; double staining immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1(Iba-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase(iNOS) in microglia of rat dentate gyrus(DG); Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of Iba-1 and iNOS of microglia in DG region of rat hippocampus. The results showed that in the model group, the number of horizontal movement, the number of vertical movement and central residence time were significantly reduced, and the grooming time was significantly prolonged(P<0.05 or P<0.01); the levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 in hippocampus increased significantly(P<0.05); the number of positive cells with co-expression of Iba-1/iNOS of microglia cells in DG region of hippocampus increased; the expression levels of Iba-1 and iNOS protein in hippocampus were significantly increased(P<0.01), suggesting that microglia in DG region of hippocampus was activated and polarized toward M1 type in rats with stress. The high dose group of Xiaoyao San significantly increased the number of horizontal movement, vertical movement and central residence time of model rats(P<0.05 or P<0.01), and significantly down-regulated the levels of inflammatory factors IL-1beta and IL-6(P<0.05). Meanwhile, it reversed the activation and quantity change of microglia in hippocampus. Although the Xiaoyao San low dose group had no significant effect on the behavioral indicators in the open field test and the levels of IL-1beta and IL-6, they all showed a trend of improvement. Low dose Xiaoyao San significantly decreased iNOS protein level(P<0.05), and high dose Xiaoyao San significantly down-regulated the protein expression of Iba-1 and iNOS in hippocampus microglia(P<0.05 or P<0.01). In conclusion, Xiaoyao San can improve anxiety and depression-like behavior in OVX combined with CUS model rats, and its mechanism is related to its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting M1 polarization of hippocampal microglia.

19568713|t|Comparative study on the protective effects of Yinchenhao Decoction against liver injury induced by alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate and carbon tetrachloride.
19568713|a|OBJECTIVE: To optimize the animal model of liver injury that can properly represent the pathological characteristics of dampness-heat jaundice syndrome of traditional Chinese medicine. METHODS: The liver injury in the model rat was induced by alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4) ) respectively, and the effects of Yinchenhao Decoction (, YCHD), a proved effective Chinese medical formula for treating the dampness-heat jaundice syndrome in clinic, on the two liver injury models were evaluated by analyzing the serum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), asparate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), malondialchehyche (MDA), total bilirubin (T-BIL), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) as well as the ratio of liver weight to body weight. The experimental data were analyzed by principal component analytical method of pattern recognition. RESULTS: The ratio of liver weight to body weight was significantly elevated in the ANIT and CCl(4) groups when compared with that in the normal control (P<0.01). The contents of ALT and T-BIL were significantly higher in the ANIT group than in the normal control (P<0.05,P<0.01), and the levels of AST, ALT and ALP were significantly elevated in CCl(4) group relative to those in the normal control P<0.01). In the YCHD group, the increase in AST, ALT and ALP levels was significantly reduced (P<0.05, P<0.01), but with no significant increase in serum T-BIL. In the CCl(4) intoxicated group, the MDA content was significantly increased and SOD, GSH-PX activities decreased significantly compared with those in the normal control group, respectively (P<0.01). The increase in MDA induced by CCl(4) was significantly reduced by YCHD P<0.05). CONCLUSION: YCHD showed significant effects on preventing liver injury progression induced by CCl(4), and the closest or most suitable animal model for damp-heat jaundice syndrome may be the one induced by CCl(4).

28154825|t|Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi Decoction, the Water Extract of Chinese Traditional Herbal Medicine, Enhances Cisplatin Cytotoxicity in A549/DDP Cells through Induction of Apoptosis and Autophagy.
28154825|a|Cisplatin is one of the most active cytotoxic agents for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. However, the development of cisplatin resistance is common. Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi decoction (BZYQD), a Chinese traditional herbal medicine, is widely used for the enhancement of antitumor effect in other medications. In this study, we evaluated the effect and drug-resistance reversal mechanism of BZYQD combined with cisplatin on cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cells. Our results showed that BZYQD exhibited direct cytotoxic and chemosensitizing effects. Cotreatment with BZYQD and cisplatin induced intrinsic apoptotic pathways which were measured by condensed nuclear chromatin, Annexin V/PI apoptosis assay, and apoptosis related proteins expression. In addition, cotreatment with BZYQD and cisplatin also activated autophagy, as indicated by an increase in LC3 puncta, classical autophagosomes and/or autolysosomes, and an accumulation of LC3-II and ATG7 protein. Finally, cotreatment with BZYQD and cisplatin resulted in the generation of ROS and scavenging ROS by NAC almost completely suppressing cell death. These results suggest that cotreatment with BZYQD and cisplatin might reverse cisplatin resistance by inducing ROS accumulation, which activates apoptosis and autophagy by oxidative stress. The combination of BZYQD and cisplatin may represent a novel approach in treatment for NSCLC and thus offer a new target for chemotherapy.

34616145|t|Identification of Active Compounds and Mechanism of Huangtu Decoction for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis by Network Pharmacology Combined with Experimental Verification.
34616145|a|INTRODUCTION: Huangtu decoction (HTD) has been widely used in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerative colitis (UC) and gastrointestinal tumors in China, but its active compounds and mechanism are still not clear yet. The present research aimed to identify the active compounds and mechanism of HTD for the treatment of UC. METHODS: Firstly, the chemical compounds of HTD were qualitatively identified based on Q Exactive Orbitrap LC-MS/MS, and their potential targets were predicted through SwissTargetPrediction. Secondly, the differential expressed genes (DEGs) in colon tissues of UC patients and normal controls were retrieved from the GEO database. Thirdly, the overlapping targets of DEGs and the predicted targets were obtained and subjected to GO and KEGG analysis. Finally, the key targets in the most significantly enriched pathway were verified by in vivo experiment, and the protein and mRNA expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), MMP3, MMP7, MMP9 and MMP12 were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blotting (WB) and quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 47 compounds were identified and 29 overlapping targets were obtained from HTD extract. The most significantly enriched pathway of overlapping targets involved was MMP. HTD improved the pathological damage in colon tissues of DSS-induced UC model and significantly decreased the serum levels of IL-1beta and IL-6. The protein and mRNA expressions of MMP1, MMP3 and MMP9 in colon tissues were significantly decreased after HTD treatment. CONCLUSION: HTD treatment can alleviate the colonic inflammation via inhibiting MMPs including MMP1, MMP3 and MMP9.

21190597|t|[Clinical research of Dahuang Fuzi decoction in auxiliary treatment of severe acute pancreatitis: a multi-center observation in 206 patients].
21190597|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of Dahuang Fuzi decoction in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and to provide valuable medical evidences for a treatment of SAP with combined traditional Chinese and western medicine. METHODS: A prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial was designed. Two hundred and six adult patients with SAP admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) in three tertiary university teaching hospitals in Dalian from January 2007 to February 2010 were randomly divided into two groups: soapsuds enema control group (control group, n=101) and Dahuang Fuzi decoction enema study group (study group, n=105). The levels of serum amylase, albumin (Alb), D-lactic acid, endotoxin and diamine oxidase (DAO), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgM), complements (C3, C4), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukins (IL-6, IL-8) were determined before and after treatment for 2, 4, 7 days. The bowel sound, gastrointestinal function score, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII) score and the length of mechanical ventilation (MV), the length of stay in ICU, the mortality rate and average hospital expenses within 28 days were compared. RESULTS: Compared with control group, in the study group the levels of serum amylase, DAO, D-lactic acid and endotoxin were lowered, the Alb was increased, the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, hs-CRP were decreased, the function of body immunity was enhanced, intestinal peristalsis was enhanced, gastrointestinal function score and APACHEII score were improved, the length of MV was reduced, the length of stay in ICU was diminished, the 28-day mortality and average hospital expenses were lowered [4 days amylase (U/L): 357.35+/-137.54 vs. 492.95+/-189.42, 2 days DAO (kU/L) : 5.20+/-0.59 vs. 5.45+/-0.72, 4 days D-lactic acid (mmol/L): 3.31+/-0.48 vs. 4.15+/-0.55, 2 days endotoxin (kEU/L): 0.29+/-0.11 vs. 0.34+/-0.14, 4 days Alb (g/L): 34.75+/-3.56 vs. 32.53+/-3.44, 2 days TNF-alpha (ng/L): 3.08+/-0.45 vs. 3.36+/-1.11, 2 days IL-6 (ng/L): 298.54+/-67.82 vs. 313.56+/-73.91, 4 days IL-8 (ng/L): 30.48+/-8.56 vs. 45.16+/-10.81, 2 days hs-CRP (mg/L): 32.56+/-11.83 vs. 40.42+/-15.10, 4 days IgG (g/L): 7.05+/-2.56 vs. 9.53+/-2.94, 2 days IgA (mg/L): 1 600+/-170 vs. 1 400+/-140, 4 days IgM (mg/L): 1 310+/-280 vs. 1 650+/-290, 4 days C3 (g/L): 1.11+/-0.09 vs. 1.50+/-0.15, 4 days C4 (g/L) : 0.32+/-0.11 vs. 0.41+/-0.10, 2 days bowel sound (times/min): 1.26+/-0.45 vs. 1.15+/-0.41, 2 days gastrointestinal function score: 2.24+/-0.98 vs. 2.42+/-1.05, 4 days APACHEII score: 16.4+/-6.8 vs. 20.1+/-7.1, the length of MV (days): 6.5+/-3.1 vs. 10.1+/-4.6, the length of stay in ICU (days): 11.3+/-6.3 vs. 13.8+/-7.5, mortality: 8.6% vs. 16.8%, average hospital expenses (yuan): 72 thousands vs. 86 thousands, P<0.05 or P<0.01]. CONCLUSION: Dahuang Fuzi decoction may enhance the intestinal peristalsis, protect the gastrointestinal barrier function, reduce the bacteria and endotoxin translocation and the releasing of inflammation mediators, protect the function of body immunity, reduce the length of MV, the length of stay in ICU, and lower the 28-day mortality and average hospital expenses, and it can improve the prognosis of patients with SAP.

10496105|t|[Autoimmune hepatitis with drug-induced pneumonia due to Sho-saiko-to].
10496105|a|A 71-year-old woman was being treated with Sho-saiko-to for chronic hepatitis. On the 14th day, she complained of dyspnea; chest X-ray films and CT scans revealed ground-glass shadows in both lung fields. Under a suspected diagnosis of drug-induced pneumonia, Sho-saiko-to was discontinued and the patient was started on prednisolone. After several days, her laboratory data and chest X-ray findings were markedly improved. Cell analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid disclosed an increase in the lymphocyte fraction and a depressed CD 4/CD 8 count. Lymphocyte stimulation tests of Sho-saiko-to and its ingredients, Ohgon and Hange, were positive in the case of peripheral lymphocytes, but not bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytes. These findings yielded a diagnosis of drug-induced pneumonia caused by Sho-saiko-to. A histologic examination of needle biopsy specimens from the liver revealed severe lymphocytic infiltration into the tissues of Glisson's capsule and liver parenchyma, and mild infiltration by plasma cells into tissues surrounding Glisson's capsule. To our knowledge, this is the first case of autoimmune hepatitis with Sho-saiko-to-induced pneumonia to be reported.

2065396|t|[Changes in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide levels in intestinal obstruction and the influence of da cheng qi decoction].
2065396|a|The role of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in small intestine obstructed rabbits and the therapeutic mechanism of Da Cheng Qi Decoction (DCQD) were studied. VIP concentrations of both blood and intestinal tissue were measured by specific radio-immunoassay in a rabbits' mechanical small intestinal obstruction model using fix of ileum to the right low abdominal wall, the influences of duodenal perfusion of DCQD on VIP levels were also investigated. 24 hours after ligating ileum, VIP of arterial plasma was elevated 7 fold, reaching 138.65 +/- 25.58 pmol/L, that of portal vein plasma was 4 times of the arterial value. VIP immunoactivity was detected in peritoneal fluid. VIP content of duodenal tissue in 16 intestine obstructed rabbits was 2 times high as that in 15 controls, whereas that of colonal tissue was inversed. DCQD caused a 50% decrease of elevated plasma VIP in experimental animals and a 65% increase in controls. The present work demonstrates that VIP might be released into the portal and peripheral circulation and mediate local and systemic pathophysiologic alterations accompanying small intestinal obstruction, such as hyperemia and edema of intestinal wall, accumulation of fluid in the lumen. VIP changes might account for the redistribution of blood flow in the obstructed segment of small intestine and the distal site of obstruction. DCQD has a therapeutic effect. The mechanism of dual modulate action of DCQD on VIP concentration is beyond our knowledge.

8275481|t|The herbal medicine sho-saiko-to inhibits proliferation of cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis and arrest at the G0/G1 phase.
8275481|a|Water-soluble ingredients of the herbal medicine sho-saiko-to dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (KIM-1) and a cholangiocarcinoma cell line (KMC-1). Fifty % effective doses on day 3 of exposure to sho-saiko-to were 353.5 +/- 32.4 micrograms/ml for KIM-1 and 236.3 +/- 26.5 micrograms/ml for KMC-1. However, almost no suppressive effects were detected in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes or normal rat hepatocytes. Sho-saiko-to suppressed the proliferation of the carcinoma cell lines significantly more strongly than did each of its major ingredients, i.e., saikosaponin a, c, and d, ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg1, glycyrrhizin, baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin, or another herbal medicine, juzen-taiho-to (P < 0.05 or 0.005). Because such ingredients are barely soluble in water, there could be synergistic or additive effects of the ingredients in sho-saiko-to. Morphological, DNA, and cell cycle analyses revealed two possible modes of action of sho-saiko-to to suppress the proliferation of carcinoma cells; (a) it induces apoptosis in the early period of exposure and (b) it induces arrest at the G0/G1 phase in the late period of exposure.

26273312|t|Si Shen Wan Regulates Phospholipase Cgamma-1 and PI3K/Akt Signal in Colonic Mucosa from Rats with Colitis.
26273312|a|The present study explored the feasible pathway of Si Shen Wan (SSW) in inhibiting apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) by observing activation of phospholipase Cgamma-1 (PLC-gamma1) and PI3K/Akt signal in colonic mucosa from rats with colitis. Experimental colitis was induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in the Sprague-Dawley rats. After SSW was administrated for 7 days after TNBS infusion, western blot showed an increment in levels of PI3K, p-Akt, and IL-23 and a decrement in levels of PLC-gamma1 and HSP70 in colonic mucosal injury induced by TNBS. Meanwhile, assessments by ELISA revealed an increment in concentrations of IL-2, IL-6, and IL-17 and a reduction in level of TGF-beta after TNBS challenge. Impressively, treatment with SSW for 7 days significantly attenuated the expressions of PI3K and p-Akt and the secretion of IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 and promoted the activation of PLC-gamma1, HSP70, and TGF-beta. Our previous studies had demonstrated that SSW restored colonic mucosal ulcers by inhibiting apoptosis of IECs. The present study demonstrated that the effect of SSW on inhibiting apoptosis of IECs was realized probably by activation of PLC-gamma1 and suppression of PI3K/Akt signal pathway.

35227178|t|Therapeutic mechanism of Xiaoqinglong decoction against COVID-19 based on network pharmacology and molecular docking technology.
35227178|a|BACKGROUND: A xiaoqinglong decoction (XQLD) has been proven effective in treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases; however, the mechanism remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: In the current study, we used network pharmacology and molecular docking technology to identify the effective components, potential targets, and biological pathways of XQLD against COVID-19. METHODS: Public databases were searched to determine the putative targets of the active compounds of XQLD and COVID-19-related targets. STRING and Cytoscape were used to establish the protein-protein interaction network and drug component, along with the target-pathway network, respectively. The DAVID database was used to enrich the biological functions and signaling pathways. AutoDock Vina was used for the virtual docking. RESULTS: We identified 138 active compounds and 259 putative targets of XQLD. Biological network analysis showed that quercetin, beta-sitosterol, kaempferol, stigmasterol, and luteolin may be critical ingredients of XQLD, whereas VEGFA, IL-6, MAPK3, CASP3, STAT3, MAPK1, MAPK8, CASP8, CCL2, and FOS may be candidate drug targets. Enrichment analysis illustrated that XQLD could function by regulating viral defense, inflammatory response, immune response, and apoptosis. Molecular docking results showed a high affinity between the critical ingredients and host cell target proteins. CONCLUSION: This study uncovered the underlying pharmacological mechanism of XQLD against COVID-19. These findings lay a solid foundation for promoting the development of new drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection and may contribute to the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

35370270|t|Analysis of Drug-Induced Liver Injury from Bofutsushosan Administration Using Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) Database.
35370270|a|Bofutsushosan is a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine. In recent years, it has been reported to be effective in the treatment of lifestyle-related diseases, and its use is increasing. However, side effects from bofutsushosan administration are common, with drug-induced liver injury being the most frequently reported complication. In this study, we analyzed the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database regarding the occurrence of liver injury after bofutsushosan administration. The results showed that bofutsushosan presented a significant reporting odds ratio (ROR) signal [crude ROR 14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 12-17; p < 0.001], indicating liver injury. Furthermore, the incidents of adverse events following bofutsushosan administration, as recorded in the JADER database, were higher in women aged between 30 and 59 years. The results of logistic regression analysis in patients taking this agent showed that females in the aforementioned age range had higher odds of developing drug-induced liver injury (adjusted ROR 5.5, 95% CI 2.8-11; p < 0.001). Therefore, although bofutsushosan is a useful drug for lifestyle-related diseases, it may be necessary to refrain from its overuse, and caution should be taken during its occasional use to avoid severe adverse events.

26510880|t|Ancient Chinese Formula Qiong-Yu-Gao Protects Against Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity Without Reducing Anti-tumor Activity.
26510880|a|Cisplatin is a highly effective anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent; however, its clinical use is severely limited by serious side effects, of which nephrotoxicity is the most important. In this study, we investigated whether Qiong-Yu-Gao (QYG), a popular traditional Chinese medicinal formula described 840 years ago, exhibits protective effects against cisplatin-induced renal toxicity. Using a mouse model of cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction, we observed that pretreatment with QYG attenuated cisplatin-induced elevations in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, ameliorated renal tubular lesions, reduced apoptosis, and accelerated tubular cell regeneration. Cisplatin-mediated elevations in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) mRNA, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein in the kidney were also significantly suppressed by QYG treatment. Furthermore, QYG reduced platinum accumulation in the kidney by decreasing the expression of copper transporter 1 and organic cation transporter 2. An in vivo study using implanted Lewis lung cancer cells revealed that concurrent administration of QYG and cisplatin did not alter the anti-tumor activity of cisplatin. Our findings suggest that the traditional Chinese medicinal formula QYG inhibits cisplatin toxicity by several mechanisms that act simultaneously, without compromising its therapeutic efficacy.

12367723|t|Effect of interleukin-12 level augmented by Kakkon-to, a herbal medicine, on the early stage of influenza infection in mice.
12367723|a|Oral administration of Kakkon-to (KT) (5.0 mg per mouse three times daily), a herbal medicine, for 8 days from 1 day before influenza virus infection exhibited therapeutic efficacy in the infected mice. The effect of KT-treatment on the levels of cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-12, was evaluated in the early phase of infection. KT was significantly effective in reducing the weight loss of infected mice, prolonging their survival times and reducing mortality. In infected mice administered with KT, virus yield in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of lungs was significantly lower than that in the control on day 3 after infection. On day 2 after infection, only the level of IL-12 in the BALF increased significantly in KT-administered mice as compared with the control. Thus the significant enhancement of IL-12 correlated with the reduction of virus yields in BALF in the early phase of infection. This suggested a key role of IL-12 in the alleviation of influenza in the KT-treated mice.

25365937|t|Sipjeondaebo-tang, a traditional herbal formula, inhibits retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy.
25365937|a|Retinal neovascularization is a common pathology in age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is a vasoactive factor and has been implicated in proliferative retinopathies. Oxygen-induced retinopathy in the mouse is the standard experimental model of proliferative retinopathies. Sipjeondaebo-tang (SDT) is the most widely used traditional herbal formula in East Asia, also known as Shi-Quan-Da-Bu-Tang in Chinese and Juzen-taiho-to in Japanese. SDT has been known to exert anti-angiogenic activities in several tumor models, but the role of SDT in proliferative retinopathies remains unclear. Thus, the object of the present study is to examine the mechanism of action and efficacy of SDT on retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR) mice. Neonatal mice at postnatal day 7 (P7) were exposed to 75% concentration of oxygen for 5 days (P7-P12), and then returned to room air from P12 to P17 to induce retinal neovascularization. SDT were administered once per day for 5 consecutive days (P12-P16) by intraperitoneal injection. Retinal neovascularization was measured at P17. We used a protein array to evaluate the expression levels of angiogenic factors. Inhibitory activity of SDT on PDGF-BB/PDGFRbeta interaction was evaluated in vitro. Retinal neovascularization in the OIR mice was significantly decreased by SDT. SDT decreased the expression levels of PDGF-BB protein and VEGF mRNA. Moreover, SDT dose-dependently inhibited PDGF-BB/PDGFRbeta interaction (IC50 = 388.82 +/- 7.31 microg/ml). In conclusion, SDT is a potent inhibitor of retinal neovascularization through inhibiting the pro-angiogenic effect of PDGF-BB.

15070171|t|Effects of Keishi-bukuryo-gan on vascular function and hemorheological factors in spontaneously diabetic (WBN/kob) rats.
15070171|a|Keishi-bukuryo-gan (Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan) is a formula used for the improvement of blood circulation. Recently it has often also been used for arteriosclerosis. One of the mechanisms involved is thought to be the improvement of endothelial dysfunction, but the details are still unclear. In this study, the effect of Keishi-bukuryo-gan on vascular function and hemorheological factors in spontaneously diabetic (WBN/kob) rats was studied. Rats were given Keishi-bukuryo-gan in chow for 30 weeks. Body weight, blood glucose, endothelium-dependent/-independent relaxation, vasocontraction by free radical-induced and contractive prostanoids, triglyceride, advanced glycation endproduct, lipid peroxides, serum NO2-/NO3- and blood viscosity were measured. The results indicated that Keishi-bukuryo-gan caused a decrease in endothelium-dependent relaxation by acetylcholine to become significantly increased, and vasocontraction induced by free radicals and contractive prostanoids was significantly decreased. Furthermore, serum NO2-/NO3- and blood viscosity were significantly decreased. From these results, it was supposed that Keishi-bukuryo-gan exerted a protective effect on the endothelium. The WBN/kob rat is a useful study model for the complications of human diabetes, and Keishi-bukuryo-gan showed a protective effect against vascular injury in the susceptible rat.

15644158|t|[Effects of Danshen Decoction on experimental gastric ulcer in rats and mice].
15644158|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preventive and therapeutic effects of Danshen Decoction on gastric ulcer in experimental animal models. METHODS: The model of water immersion restraint stress ulcer in mice, and the models of acetic acid impaired gastric ulcer and pyloric ligation gastric ulcer in rats were established. The total gastric acid, the activity of pepsin and the amount of gastric wall binding mucus were detected. RESULTS: Danshen Decoction reduced the acute gastric mucosal lesion. The effect of 5.0 or 10.0 g/kg group was obviously better than that of the normal saline control group (P<0.05 and P<0.01 respectively). Danshen Decoction accelerated the healing of ulcer induced by acetic acid significantly, and increased the content of gastric wall binding mucus (P<0.01); and it also inhibited the formation of gastric ulcer induced by pyloric ligation, while having no influence on the secretion of gastric acid and the activity of pepsin. CONCLUSION: Danshen Decoction has a significant anti-ulcerative effect, which may be related to improving the gastric mucosal defensive function.

24963216|t|Effect of Sipjeondaebo-tang on cancer-induced anorexia and cachexia in CT-26 tumor-bearing mice.
24963216|a|Cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia are a multifactorial condition described by a loss of body weight and muscle with anorexia, asthenia, and anemia. Moreover, they correlate with a high mortality rate, poor response to chemotherapy, poor performance status, and poor quality of life. Cancer cachexia is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF- alpha). In addition, glucagon like peptide-1 (GIP-1), peptide YY (PYY), ghrelin, and leptin plays a crucial role in food intake. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of one of the traditional herbal medicines, Sipjeondaebo-tang (Juzen-taiho-to in Japanese; SJDBT), on cancer anorexia and cachexia in a fundamental mouse cancer anorexia/cachexia model, CT-26 tumor-bearing mice. SJDBT was more significantly effective in a treatment model where it was treated after anorexia and cachexia than in a prevention model where it was treated before anorexia and cachexia on the basis of parameters such as weights of muscles and whole body and food intakes. Moreover, SJDBT inhibited a production of IL-6, MCP-1, PYY, and GLP-1 and ameliorated cancer-induced anemia. Therefore, our in vivo studies provide evidence on the role of SJDBT in cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia, thereby suggesting that SJDBT may be useful for treating cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia.

25165477|a|Objective. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Weijing decoction combined with routine pharmacotherapy (RP) for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating Weijing decoction for AECOPD were included. English, Chinese, and Japanese databases were searched from their respective inceptions to June 2013. The methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. All data were analyzed and synthesized using RevMan 5.2 software. Results. Fifteen (15) studies involving 986 participants were included. Participants were diagnosed with COPD in the acute exacerbation stage. In addition, most of studies reported that they included participants with the Chinese medicine syndrome, phlegm-heat obstructing the Lung. Weijing decoction combined with RP improved lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second; FEV1), arterial blood gases (PaO2 and PaCO2), clinical effective rate, and reduced inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-alpha and IL-8) when compared with RP alone. No severe adverse events were reported in these studies. Conclusions. Weijing decoction appeared to be beneficial for AECOPD and well-tolerated when taken concurrently with RP, such as antibiotics, bronchodilators (oral and inhaled), and mucolytics.

15181651|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a herbal medicine (Mao-to) on psychiatric complications caused by IFN, and to examine the relationship between depression and microcirculation. METHODS: Twelve patients with chronic hepatitis C and a past history of IFN-induced depression were enrolled in this study. Their mental state was evaluated by the self-rating depression scale (SDS)> or =40, or M-R of the Cornell medical index (CMI)> or =10. Each patient received a daily dose of 6 million units of IFN-beta for 8 weeks, and Mao-to was given orally four times a day during the IFN-beta course. RESULTS: All patients in this study completed a full course of IFN. Mean CMI scores (M-R) had significantly decreased at the end of the treatment. Mean erythrocyte aggregability and erythrocyte deformability had also significantly decreased at the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Mao-to might be useful for preventing the incidence of depression in patients with chronic hepatitis C being treated with IFN. The mechanism by which Mao-to prevents depression is suggested to be through the improvement of microcirculation.

9989661|t|Comparison of immunopharmacological actions of 8 kinds of kampo-hozais clinically used in atopic dermatitis on delayed-type hypersensitivity in mice.
9989661|a|We studied here the effects of 8 kinds of kampo-hozais clinically used to treat atopic dermatitis (Shofu-san, Toki-inshi, Unsei-in, Oren-gedoku-to, Ji-zuso-ippo, Jumi-haidoku-to, Juzen-taiho-to, Hochu-ekki-to) on delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), using three types of murine models such as picryl chloride (PC)-induced (contact hypersensitivity), sheep red blood cell (SRBC)-induced (Jones-Mote's reaction) and tuberculin-induced DTH response, in order to clarify and to compare the immunopharmacological action of kampo-hozais. Most of the kampo-hozais investigated here suppressed PC-induced contact hypersensitivity, especially at the inductive phase. Comparing the efficacies of these kampo-hozais on the three types of DTH responses in mice, they were generally divided into 4 groups. Shofu-san significantly reduced PC-induced and tuberculin-induced DTH responses but not a SRBC-induced DTH response. On the other hand, Toki-inshi reduced contact hypersensitivity, tuberculin type DTH response and Jones-Mote's reaction. Ji-zuso-ippo and Juzen-taiho-to suppressed mainly Jones-Mote's reaction, and Unsei-in, Oren-gedoku-to and Jumi-haidoku-to intensively suppressed contact hypersensitivity. We thought that these findings could help us understand how to use these kampo-hozais properly.

35135448|t|Mechanism of action of Ermiao San on rheumatoid arthritis based on bioinformatics and molecular dynamics.
35135448|a|BACKGROUND: Ermiao San, one Chinese medicine formula, has been widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis(RA). Our previous study has demonstrated that Ermiao San is effective in treating RA. However, the pharmacological mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to decipher the potential mechanism of action of Ermiao San on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by bioinformatics, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics. METHODS: Gene expression data (GSE77298) were from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by R. The active ingredients of Huangbai (Phellodendron) and Cangshu (Atractylodes), two main constituents of Ermiao San, and their predicted target genes were retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) platform. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the overlapping genes between DEGs of the RA dataset and the predicted target genes of Ermiao San. The gene-gene interaction network was analyzed and visualized by Cytoscape. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations were performed to study the interaction between selected target genes (Chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1)) and active ingredients (quercetin and wogonin) of Ermiao San. RESULTS: A total of 16 potential targets for Ermiao San were found, with their significantly enriched GO terms as cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, oxidoreductase activity, cell space, etc., and the most enriched KEGG terms as an IL-17 signaling pathway, rheumatoid arthritis, and NF-kappaB signaling pathway. CCL2 and MMP1 were identified and verified to be the targets of both quercetin and wogonin, the two active ingredients of Ermiao San, by molecular docking and molecular dynamics. CONCLUSION: Ermiao San may target CCL2 and MMP1 via its active ingredients to exert its therapeutic effects on RA.

10669260|t|Effect of Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41), a Japanese herbal medicine, on the survival of mice infected with influenza virus.
10669260|a|The antiviral effect of Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41), a Japanese herbal medicine, was investigated using mice infected with influenza virus. TJ-41 was found to increase the survival rate, prolong the mean survival days, suppress viral growth in bronchoalveolar labage fluid (BALF) and inhibit the lung index (lung consolidation) on day 4 after infection in mice infected with influenza, after the agent had been administered orally once daily from day 7 to 2 before infection and from day 0 to 4 after infection. Administration of TJ-41 decreased the BALF concentrations of IL-1alpha, IL-6 and GM-CSF, but not TNF-alpha or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), on day 4 after infection. In addition, TJ-41 elevated the level of IFN-alpha in BALF on day 2 after infection. Yet, TJ-41 did not show any inhibitory effect on the growth of influenza virus in vitro. These results suggest that TJ-41 exerts its inhibitory effect on influenza virus infection via enhancement of the host immune responses in this experimental murine system.

34399822|t|Traditional herbal formula Wu-Mei-Wan alleviates TNBS-induced colitis in mice by inhibiting necroptosis through increasing RIPK3 O-GlcNAcylation.
34399822|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicated that necroptosis plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) of necroptotic signal molecule receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3 (RIPK3) was reported to exert a protective effect in gut inflammation. Our recent study suggested traditional Chinese herbal formula Wu-Mei-Wan (WMW) as an effective prescription in mouse colitis. However, the potential mechanisms are not fully understood. Considering the crucial role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of IBD, therefore, this study was designed to explain whether the anti-colitis effect of WMW is mediated by modulating necroptosis and its related mechanisms. METHODS: The protective effects of WMW on colitis have been determined by detecting colitis mice body weight, disease activity index (DAI), survival rate and colon length. Colonic inflammation was examined by inflammatory cells infiltration and local cytokines levels. After then, we measured the levels of necroptosis and O-GlcNAcylation. C O-immunoprecipitation experiments were used to address whether elevated O-GlcNAcylation can inhibit necroptotic signal transduction in the treatment of WMW. Finally, the key enzymes in O-GlcNAcylation: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) were examined and molecular docking analysis was used to determine effective natural compounds in the regulation on OGT and OGA activities. RESULTS: Our results showed that WMW significantly improved mice body weight, survival rate and colon length, decreased DAI in TNBS-induced colitis. WMW obviously alleviated colonic inflammatory responses with reduced macrophages, neutrophils infiltration and local IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels. It was found that WMW increased colonic O-GlcNAcylation level and inhibited the activation of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL. Then, further experiments revealed that WMW enhanced OGT activity and suppressed OGA activity, thereby increasing RIPK3 O-GlcNAcylation and inhibiting the binding of RIPK3 and MLKL, which led to the inhibition of necroptosis. Additionally, docking analysis demonstrated that hesperidin, coptisine and ginsenoside Rb1 may exert a major role in the regulation on OGT and OGA activities by WMW. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrated that WMW can alleviate TNBS-induced colitis in mice by inhibiting necroptosis through increasing RIPK3 O-GlcNAcylation.

9504440|t|Effects of sho-saiko-to extract on fibrosis and regeneration of the liver in rats.
9504440|a|Sho-saiko-to, one of the most widely used Chinese herbal preparations, has long been used for the treatment of chronic liver diseases. We have investigated its effect in retarding the process of liver fibrosis and accelerating liver regeneration, especially its effect on Ito cells that are thought to be deeply involved with liver fibrosis. Sho-saiko-to extract and its active constituents were orally administered to rats with dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver-injury. After treatment with sho-saiko-to extract hepatic function improved, histopathological results confirmed repair of liver tissue, and retinoid levels increased. On the other hand, when active constituents of sho-saiko-to extract were administered alone, liver retinoid levels remained low, implying that interaction among active constituents of the extract was suppressing Ito cell activation. When sho-saiko-to extract was administered to 70% hepatectomized normal and liver-injured rats, liver weight, the number of S-phase-cells and retinoid levels increased with time. However, these changes were different for normal and liver-injured rats, suggesting that the site of action of sho-saiko-to extract in regenerating liver is different for normal and liver-injured rats. These results show that sho-saiko-to extract was useful for suppressing the activation of Ito cells.

35285199|a|This study explored the mechanism of Shenling Baizhu Powder(SLBZP) in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes from the perspective of flora disorder and chronic inflammation. Fifty rats were randomly divided into normal control group, model control group, low-dose SLBZP group, medium-dose SLBZP group, and high-dose SLBZP group, with 10 rats in each group. The rats of 5 weeks old were administrated by gavage with ultrapure water and different doses of SLBZP decoction. The basic indicators such as body weight and blood glucose were monitored every week, and stool and intestinal contents were collected from the rats of 9 weeks old for 16 S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis. An automatic biochemical analyzer was used to measure the serum biochemical indicators, ELISA to measure serum insulin, and chipsets to measure leptin and inflammatory cytokines. The results showed that SLBZP reduced the body weight as well as blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and lipid levels. In the rats of 9 weeks, the relative abundance of Anaerostipes, Turicibacter, Bilophila, Ochrobactrum, Acinetobacter, and Prevotella decreased significantly in the model control group, which can be increased in the high-dose SLBZP group; the relative abundance of Psychrobacter, Lactobacillus, Roseburia and Staphylococcus significantly increased in the model control group, which can be down-regulated in the high-dose SLBZP group. The differential metabolites of intestinal flora included 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, octanoic acid, 3-indolepropionic acid, oxoglutaric acid, malonic acid, 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, and methylmalonic acid. Moreover, SLBZP significantly lowered the levels of free insulin, insulin resistance and leptin resistance in rats. The variations in the serum levels of interleukin 1beta(IL-1beta) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1) showed that SLBZP could alleviate chronic inflammation in rats. In conclusion, SLBZP can regulate intestinal flora and metabolites and relieve chronic inflammation to control obesity and prevent type 2 diabetes.

16644487|t|Xiao chai hu tang inhibits CVB1 virus infection of CCFS-1 cells through the induction of Type I interferon expression.
16644487|a|Coxsackie B virus type 1 (CVB1) infection is known to cause high morbidity and mortality in children, however, there is no effective drug for treating this disease. The present study aimed to examine the antiviral activity of xiao chai hu tang (XCHT), a popular herbal drug for treating viral and bacterial infections, against CVB1 infection and its mechanisms of action. Our data showed that XCHT neutralized the CVB1-induced cytopathic effect in human neonatal foreskin fibroblast cell line (CCFS-1/KMC), with IC50 (virus-induced cytopathic effect by 50%) and EC50 (concentration of 50% effectiveness) values around 12.39 and 50.93 microg/ml, respectively. Its CC50 (concentration of 50% cellular cytotoxicity) and SI (selective index) values were 945.75 microg/ml and 18.92, respectively. These results suggest that XCHT possessed anti-CVB1 activity, and showed no effect on CCFS-1 cell viability and growth at concentration 250 microg/ml. The time-of-addition studies showed that XCHT (50, 100 and 200 microg/ml) added at various time of preinfection (-1 to -3 h), coinfection (0 h) and postinfection (1 approximately 3 h) could inhibit CVB1 infection. Interestingly, XCHT also showed an inhibition on viral replication through the induction of IFN-alpha/beta expression. In conclusion, XCHT possessed antiviral activity against CVB1 infection. It interfered the early stage of viral replication (prophylactic effect) and viral replication after infection (therapeutic effect) through the induction of Type I interferon expression.

15706902|t|[Effect of association of Shiquandabu Tang with Hetaokun on liver and immunity of tumour mouse].
15706902|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effect of the association of Shiquandabutang with Hetaokun on the protection to liver and immunity of tumor mouse S180. METHOD: Through the comparison between tumor transplanted and tumor cultured completely out of cell body, the effect was investigated, with Hetaokun singly used and Shiquandabutang associated with Hetaokun, on the level of SGPT, licking up function of monocyte macrophage, thymus index, spleen index and transform percentage of lymphocyte of the mouse S180. The scanning electron micrographs indicated the protective function of the association of Shiquandabutang with Hetaokun for liver. RESULT: 12.5 mg x kg(-1) Hetaokun could obviously restrain the tumor when it was singly used at 73.1%, but it increased SGPT at the same time. The association of Shiquandabutang with Hetaokun could protect liver of the mouse S180. SGPT (P > 0.05) was compared with the common ones and the result showed that the association of shiquandabutang with Hetaokun could make K value increase (P > 0.01). Through the scanning electron micrographs, association of two medicines was found to change liver cells little and expansion of rough Neizhiwang was not found. Compared with the control group, the immunity of the two tumor mouse groups taking the medicine mentioned above was promoted obviously.

34349830|t|Danggui Buxue Tang Ameliorates Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis by Suppressing the TLR4/NLRP3 Signaling Pathway in Rats.
34349830|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT) on rats with pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Sixty specific pathogen-free (SPF) male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, PF, prednisone treatment, and DBT treatment. Intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (BLM) was performed to establish a PF rat model. DBT was administered to PF rats concurrently for 2 weeks. Lung samples were then collected for HE and Masson staining after pulmonary function testing, and semiquantitative analysis for the degree of alveolitis and fibrosis was performed using the Szapiel and Ashcroft score systems. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, hydroxyproline (HYP), hyaluronic acid (HA), and inflammatory cytokine content were measured. Western blotting was performed to detect fibrotic marker and TLR4/NLRP3 signaling pathway changes. RESULTS: Oral administration of DBT attenuated weight loss, survival rate, and pulmonary index. Lung histopathologic lesions were also reduced. DBT inhibited PF by decreasing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and collagen deposition. Specifically, DBT reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, HYP, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), collagen I, and collagen III levels. Corollary experiments identified a potential mechanism involving suppression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway activation and the NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 axis, the downstream regulatory pathway. CONCLUSION: DBT exhibited a potent effect on BLM-induced PF rats by inhibiting the TLR4/NLRP3 signaling pathway. Thus, DBT alleviates pulmonary inflammation to inhibit fibrotic pathology and should be considered as a candidate for the clinical treatment of PF.

24525674|t|In Vitro and In Vivo Effects of Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San in Human Breast Cancer MCF-7 Cells Treated With Tamoxifen.
24525674|a|INTRODUCTION: There is epidemiological evidence that Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San (JWXYS) is the most common Chinese medicine decoction coprescribed with tamoxifen (Tam) when breast cancer is treated by hormonal therapy. However, whether there is interaction between JWXYS and Tam remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of JWXYS on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells treated with Tam. METHODS: In vitro cultured MCF-7 cells were cotreated with JWXYS and Tam. This was followed by MTT ([4,5-cimethylthiazol-2-yl]- 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assays and cell cycle analysis to assess cell proliferation; Western blot analysis was used to analyze the expression of various proteins involved in growth-related signal pathways. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to detect autophagy among the cancer cells. In vivo analysis used female athymic nude mice implanted with MCF-7 cells; these mice were randomly assigned to 6 groups. All mice were killed humanely after 21 days of treatment; body weight, tumor volume, and tumor weight were then measured. RESULTS: JWXYS was not cytotoxic to MCF-7 cells, based on the fact that there were no statistically significant changes between the JWXYS + Tam groups and the Tam-alone group in cell numbers, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation signals, the latter including the expression levels of AKT, ERK, P38, p27(Kip1), and light chain (LC3)-I, II. Furthermore, using the MCF-7 xenograft mouse model, there were no significant changes between the JWXYS (1.3-3.9 gm/kg) + Tam groups and the Tam-alone group in terms of tumor weight and the protein expression levels of AKT, ERK, P38, and p27 (Kip1). However, there was a significant decrease in LC3-II protein expression with the low-dose JWXYS + Tam group but not with the middle- or high-dose JWXYS + Tam groups compared with the Tam-alone group. CONCLUSION: Based on in vitro studies and in vivo functional studies, there is no obvious interaction between JWXYS and Tam. However, the presence of interference at the molecular level in relation to LC3-II expression provides important information and may affect treatment strategies when physicians have patients with estrogen receptor-alpha(+) or progesterone receptor(+) breast cancers.

28392956|t|Effects of Herbal Medicine (Gan Mai Da Zao Decoction) on Several Types of Neuropsychiatric Disorders in an Animal Model: A Systematic Review: Herbal medicine for animal studies of neuropsychiatric diseases.
28392956|a|OBJECTIVES: Gan Mai Da Zao (GMDZ) decoction is widely used for the treatment of various diseases of the internal organ and of the central nervous system. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of GMDZ decoction on neuropsychiatric disorders in an animal model. METHODS: We searched seven databases for randomized animal studies published until April 2015: Pubmed, four Korean databases (DBpia, Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System, Korean Studies Information Service System, and Research Information Sharing Service), and one Chinese database (China National Knowledge Infrastructure). The randomized animal studies were included if the effects of GMDZ decoction were tested on neuropsychiatric disorders. All articles were read in full and extracted predefined criteria by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: From a total of 258 hits, six randomized controlled animal studies were included. Five studies used a Sprague Dawley rat model for acute psychological stress, post-traumatic stress disorders, and unpredictable mild stress depression whereas one study used a Kunming mouse model for prenatal depression. The results of the studies showed that GMDZ decoction improved the related outcomes. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the dose and concentration used, GMDZ decoction significantly improved neuropsychiatric disease-related outcomes in animal models. However, additional systematic and extensive studies should be conducted to establish a strong conclusion.

33763148|t|Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi Granule Enhances Colonic Tight Junction Integrity via TLR4/NF-kappaB/MLCK Signaling Pathway in Ulcerative Colitis Rats.
33763148|a|BACKGROUND: Bu-zhong-yi-qi granule (BZYQ), a sort of Chinese herbal medicine, has exhibited therapeutic effects on ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the mechanism of BZYQ has not been fully clarified. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of BZYQ on UC rats model and at exploring its potential mechanism. METHODS: The UC rats were established by enema of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The therapeutic effects of BZYQ treatment were evaluated by disease activity index (DAI), colon macroscopic damage index (CMDI) scores, and histological observation. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, occludin and claudin-1, in the colon was determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence. The expression of toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), p-NF-kappaB, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), MLC, and p-MLC levels in colon was determined by Western blot or qPCR. RESULTS: The results showed that BZYQ could attenuate DAI, CMDI, and histological inflammation. TJ proteins expression was decreased in UC rats, but treatment with BZYQ restored the expression of occludin and claudin-1. In addition, BZYQ administration ameliorated UC-associated increase in the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and the expression of TLR4, NF-kappaB, p-NF-kappaB, MLCK, MLC, and p-MLC, while BZYQ administration increased the production of IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of BZYQ on UC is at least partially through regulation of the secretion of some inflammatory cytokines and improvement of TJ integrity via TLR4/NF-kappaB/MLCK pathway.

35026523|t|Wuzhuyu Decoction relieves hyperalgesia by regulating central and peripheral 5-HT in chronic migraine model rats.
35026523|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic migraine (CM) is a highly disabling and burdensome disease. Wuzhuyu decoction (WZYD), a clinical used formula to treat and prevent episodic migraine and CM, has been reported to relieve the hyperalgesia of CM and increase brainstem and blood serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in migraine model rats in previous studies; yet the mechanism is unclear. PURPOSE: This study aimed to observe the hyperalgesia relief effect of WZYD and investigate the mechanistic association with the regulation on central and peripheral 5-HT. METHODS: WZYD with different doses (3.372, 1.686 and 0.843 g/kgd) and the positive drug - sumatriptan (5.83 mg/kg3 d) were intragastrically administered in inflammatory soup (IS)-induced CM model rats, respectively. Hyperalgesia was assessed by facial mechanical withdrawal threshold and tail-flick latency. 5-HT was determined by ELISA. Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence determination, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were performed. RESULTS: WZYD significantly relieved the hyperalgesia by elevating the facial mechanical withdrawal threshold and tail-flick latency. In WZYD groups, increased 5-HT and decreased calcitonin gene-related peptide in both the brainstem and plasma, downregulated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and c-fos expression in the brainstem were observed in dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, 5-HT in colon tissues were also observed, which is associated with upregulating tryptophan hydroxylase, serotonin transporter and Piezo1 expression and increasing 5-HT and chromogranin A in enterochromaffin cells. Disorder of the microbiota, function and metabolism was correlated with 5-HT synthesis. WZYD could regulate the abundance of Anaerostipes and Acidifaciens. CONCLUSION: WZYD has the pharmacological effect on relieving hyperalgesia in CM model rats, possibly by affecting central and peripheral 5-HT.

27400466|t|Efficacy and safety of Yinchenwuling powder for hyperlipidemia: a systematic review and Meta-analysis.
27400466|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse effects of Yinchenwuling powder (YCWLP) in the treatment of hyperlipidemia using Meta-analysis. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of YCWLP for hyperlipidemia published in any language prior to February 2015. Two reviewers independently identified articles, extracted data, assessed quality, and cross-checked the results. Revman 5.3 was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Only five randomized controlled trials with poor methodology were included in the analysis. The five trials compared YCWLP with conventional lipid-lowering drugs. Meta-analysis indicated that YCWLP was more effective at the levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol without serious adverse effects. However, it was not more effective than lipid-lowering drugs in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improving hemorheology. CONCLUSION: YCWLP appeared to improve lipid levels. However, given the high risk of bias among the trials, we could not conclude that YCWLP was beneficial to patients with hyperlipidemia. More rigorous trials are required to provide stronger evidence for the conclusion.

35186100|t|The Traditional Chinese Medicine "Hu-Qian-Wan" Attenuates Osteoarthritis-Induced Signs and Symptoms in an Experimental Rat Model of Knee Osteoarthritis.
35186100|a|BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a chronic, low-grade inflammatory disease that affects knee joints and causes functional disability in the elderly. KOA is typically treated with oral NSAIDs, which are commonly associated with gastrointestinal side effects or cardiovascular complications. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely used by patients with KOA in Taiwan; the Hu-Qian-Wan (HQW) formula is typically prescribed. We investigated the therapeutic role of a modified version of the HQW decoction in Sprague-Dawley rats with KOA induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) of the right knee. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty rats were randomly assigned to five groups (six animals each): arthrotomy alone (sham surgery, controls), ACLT only, ACLT + low-dose (1,000 mg/kg) HQW, ACLT + high-dose (3,000 mg/kg) HQW, and ACLT + celecoxib (30 mg/kg). All study groups underwent weight-bearing behavioral testing, micro-computed tomography (CT), and histological examinations of the knee joint cartilage, as well as immunohistochemical analyses of levels of interleukin (IL) 1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha expression in articular cartilage. RESULTS: At 6 weeks, compared with ACLT group only, ACLT rats administered high-dose HQW or celecoxib exhibited the fewest weight-bearing deficits, the greatest improvements from baseline in articular cartilage architecture, and the lowest amounts of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta staining in cartilage and synovial sections (all values were significant compared with the ACLT-only group). The only values that were significantly increased by ACLT + low-dose HQW compared with ACLT alone were bone mineral density and trabecular numbers. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that high-dose HQW improves weight-bearing asymmetry, decreases bone loss, and reduces levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in the affected joint in ACLT-induced KOA rats. More evidence is needed to support our findings.

35003291|t|Huanglian Jiedu Decoction Exerts Antipyretic Effect by Inhibiting MAPK Signaling Pathway.
35003291|a|AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the antipyretic effect and potential mechanism of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HLJDD) on LPS-induced fever in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The fever rat model was established by LPS. Anal temperature of rats was measured every 1 hour after modeling. TNF-alpha, IL-6, PGE2, and cAMP in rat serum or hypothalamus tissue were detected by ELISA kit. In order to explore the potential active ingredients and mechanism of antipyretic effect of HLJDD, we predicted the underlying antipyretic mechanism by using network pharmacology and then verified its mechanism by Western Blotting. RESULTS: The results showed that HLJDD can alleviate LPS-induced fever in rats. The expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, PGE2, and cAMP in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the model group. Western Blotting results showed that the protein expression of p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-P38 was significantly inhibited. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that HLJDD has a good antipyretic effect on LPS-induced fever in rats, which may be closely related to the inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway.

26694358|t|Effect of Guibi-Tang, a Traditional Herbal Formula, on Retinal Neovascularization in a Mouse Model of Proliferative Retinopathy.
26694358|a|Ocular pathologic angiogenesis is an important causative risk factor of blindness in retinopathy of prematurity, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and neovascular macular degeneration. Guibi-tang (GBT) is a frequently used oriental herbal formula in East Asian countries, and is also called Qui-pi-tang in Chinese and Kihi-To in Japanese. In the present study, we investigated the preventive effect of GBT on retinal pathogenic neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 75% hyperoxia for five days on postnatal day 7 (P7). The mice were then exposed to room air from P12 to P17 to induce ischemic proliferative retinopathy. GBT (50 or 100 mg/kg/day) was intraperitoneally administered daily for five days (from P12 to P16). On P17, Retinal neovascularization was measured on P17, and the expression levels of 55 angiogenesis-related factors were analyzed using protein arrays. GBT significantly decreased retinal pathogenic angiogenesis in OIR mice, and protein arrays revealed that GBT decreased PAI-1 protein expression levels. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that GBT reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) mRNA levels in OIR mice. GBT promotes potent inhibitory activity for retinal neovascularization by decreasing VEGF, FGF2, and PAI-1 levels.

20688304|t|Prescriptions of Chinese herbal medicine for constipation under the national health insurance in Taiwan.
20688304|a|BACKGROUND: Constipation is a common gastrointestinal problem worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of use and prescriptive patterns of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in treating constipation by analyzing the claims data of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) from the National Health Insurance (NHI) in Taiwan. METHODS: The computerized claims dataset of the TCM office visits and the corresponding prescription files in 2004 compiled by the NHI Research Institute in Taiwan were linked and processed. Visit files with the single diagnostic coding of constipation (ICD-9-CM code 564.0) were extracted to analyze the frequency and pattern of corresponding CHM prescriptions. The association rule was applied to analyze the co-prescription of CHM in treating constipation. RESULTS: There were 152,564 subjects who visited TCM clinics only for constipation in Taiwan during 2004 and received a total of 387,268 CHM prescriptions. Subjects between 20 and 29 years of age comprised the largest number of those treated (25.5%). Female subjects used CHM for constipation more frequently than male subjects (female:male = 3.31:1). There was an average of 4.6 items of single Chinese herbs or formula in a single prescription for constipation. Ma-zi-renwan was the most commonly prescribed herbal formula, while Da-huang (Rheum palmatum) was the most commonly used single Chinese herb. According to the association rule, the most common prescribed pattern of 2-drug combination of CHM for treating constipation was Ban-xia-xie-xin-tang plus Ma-zi-ren-wan, while the 3-drug combination of CHM was Fang-feng-tong-sheng-san, Rheum palmatum and Ma-zi-ren-wan. CONCLUSION: This study showed the pattern of single Chinese herbs or herbal formulae used in treating constipation in Taiwan. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these CHMs in treating constipation.

24992762|t|Effect of Zhuyeshigao granule on tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukins serum protein levels in rats with radiation esophagitis.
24992762|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Zhuyeshigao granule (ZSG) on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8 in rats with radiation esophagitis. METHODS: Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (10 rats in each group): control (without radiation), saline-treated, and low, medium, and high-dose ISG-treated groups. Rats were given normal saline (10 mL/kg) or 1.15, 2.3, or 4.6 g/kg ZSG by intragastric administration once a day for 7 days. A rat model of radiation esophagitis was established by local irradiation of Co60 (490.25 cGy/min, totaling 30 Gy). The administration of ZSG was continued for another 7 days and on the 7th day post-irradiation, inferior vena cava blood was collected. The serum was separated, and TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8 protein levels were determined. RESULTS: Inflammatory response factors were found in the serum of each group. However, levels in ZSG-treated groups were significantly lower than in the saline-treated group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ZSG may prevent the development of radiation esophagitis, perhaps by inhibiting the generation and release of the inflammatory response factors TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8.

29399136|t|Sijunzi decoction-treated rat serum induces apoptosis of side population cells in gastric carcinoma.
29399136|a|Sijunzi decoction (SJZD) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Previous studies have indicated that SJZD exhibits antitumor activity. However, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated. To explore the antitumor mechanism of SJZD, the effects of serum from rats treated with SJZD on the proliferation of MKN-28 and HGC-27 gastric carcinoma cell lines were systematically investigated. It was found that SJZD-treated rat serum significantly inhibited the growth of MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells in vitro. The results obtained from a colony formation assay showed that SJZD-treated rat serum decreased the colony formation ability of MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells. The apoptosis rate in MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells was also increased following treatment with SJZD-treated rat serum. Flow cytometry with cell sorting revealed the presence of side population (SP) cells in MKN-28 and HGC-27 cells though Hoechst 33342 staining, and verapamil reduced the SP percentage. Further analysis showed that SJZD-treated rat serum promoted the apoptosis of SP cells in MKN-28 and HGC-27 cell lines by upregulating Bax, caspase-3 and PARP and downregulating bcl-2. These data revealed the therapeutic effect of SJZD-treated rat serum on gastric carcinoma. Following the preliminary identification of the inhibitory effect on the growth of gastric cancer cells in vitro, the growth inhibitory effect of SJZD-treated rat serum on SP cells was confirmed, and this inhibition particularly involved the induction of cell apoptosis.

21527335|t|A single arm phase II study of a Far-Eastern traditional herbal formulation (sho-sai-ko-to or xiao-chai-hu-tang) in chronic hepatitis C patients.
21527335|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hepatitis C is a major public health problem internationally. Many patients cannot benefit from the current treatment regimen (interferon/ribavirin combinations) due to its side effects or ineffectiveness. Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang or Sho-sai-ko-to (SST), a compound of seven botanical extracts used for liver diseases traditionally in East Asia, was shown to reduce transaminases and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B patients. We conducted a phase II trial of SST in hepatitis C patients who were not candidates for interferon-based therapy to determine whether this agent is worthy of further study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty four chronic hepatitis C patients received SST at 2.5 g per os (p.o.) three times daily (t.i.d.) for 12 months. Liver function, hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral load and liver biopsy histology were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Improvement of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was observed in 16 (67%) of study participants. Improvement of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was seen in 18 (75%) patients. Viral load response was mixed, with 7 patients showing reductions, 10 increases and 7 indeterminate due to assay limitations. Among the 9 (38%) subjects who showed improvement per Knodell's histology activity index (HAI) scores in paired comparison of pre- and post-treatment liver biopsy (the primary endpoints of the study), 5 (21%) showed an improvement of 2 points or greater, meeting the pre-defined criteria for "response. CONCLUSIONS: Sho-sai-ko-to (SST or Xiao Chai Hu Tang) may improve liver pathology in selected hepatitis C patients who are not candidates for interferon based treatment. Larger, controlled studies of this botanical formulation may be warranted.

19253432|t|[Protective effects of Huanglian-Jiedu-Tang on chronic brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia in mice].
19253432|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neuroprotective effects of Chinese herb medicine Huanglian-Jiedu-Tang (HJDT) on chronic brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia in mice. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of right middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 15 min. HJDT (at dosage of 2 g/kg or 4 g/kg, qd, orally) was administered for 21 d from d 7 before ischemia until d 14 after ischemia. The sham and ischemic controls were administered with normal saline orally. The neurological deficit scoring and the inclined board testing were performed within 35 d after ischemia. The survival rate, the infarct volume and the neuron density were assessed 35 d after ischemia. RESULT: HJDT increased the survival rate at dose of 4 g/kg; significantly reduced the neurological deficits, infarct volume and cerebral atrophy at doses of 2 and 4 g/kg after ischemia; and significantly increased the neuron density in the ischemic hippocampal CA1 region, striatum and cortex at dose of 4 g/kg but only increase the density in hippocampal CA1 region at dose of 2 g/kg. CONCLUSION: Chinese herb medicine HJDT has neuroprotective effects on chronic brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia in mice.

27853076|a|We herein describe the first known case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) associated with the administration of Makyo-kanseki-to, a Chinese herbal drug. A 64-year-old man with bronchial asthma presented with persistent cough. Makyo-kanseki-to was prescribed as an adjunctive treatment for bronchial asthma. Immediately after drug ingestion, the patient expectorated bloody sputum. DAH was diagnosed based on the presence of bilateral ground-glass opacity which was identified on chest computed tomography and bloody bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. We diagnosed that the administration of Makyo-kanseki-to was the responsible medication because the hemorrhage developed immediately after drug ingestion and resolved after the cessation of such medication with no subsequent recurrence.

16596174|a|This study was performed to examine the relationship between the anti-tumor effects of herbal medicine and endometrial carcinoma with ER-related mechanisms. An endometrial cancer cell line (Ishikawa) was used for this study. The cell viability and expression of estrogen receptors (ER) were determined by MTT and RT-PCR. A dose-dependent decrease of viability and apoptosis of the cancer cells was generated by exposure to the herbal medicines, Juzen-taiho-to or Shimotsu-to. The expression of ER-alpha mRNA, but not ER-beta mRNA was suppressed by Juzen-taiho-to or Shimotsu-to in an endometrial cancer cell line. The anti-tumor effect of these herbal medicines against endometrial carcinoma might be correlated to the ER-alpha related mechanism.

32914833|t|Therapeutic potential of Liuwei Dihuang pill against KDM7A and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy-related osteoporosis.
32914833|a|The effects of Liuwei Dihuang pill (LWDH) on diabetic nephropathy-related osteoporosis (DNOP) are unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of LWDH on KDM7A and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in DNOP rats and the high glucose-induced MC3T3-E1 cells. A DNOP model was prepared by streptozotocin in 9-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to evaluate the effects of LWDH. The cell viability and differentiation capacity of high glucose-induced MC3T3-E1 cells were determined by CCK-8 assay, Alizarin Red staining, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, respectively. Furthermore, the expressions of KDM7A and Wnt1/beta-catenin pathway-related proteins were determined by Western blot analysis. Treatment of DNOP rats with LWDH could significantly ameliorate the general state, degradation of renal function, and renal pathological changes. LWDH decreased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, ALP, and TRAP, and increased the calcium, phosphorus in serum, as well as decreased the level of the calcium and phosphorus in the urine. Besides, LWDH significantly improved bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume (BV), and the bone microstructure of DNOP rats. Moreover, LWDH increased the levels of the elastic modulus, ultimate load, and bending strength in the femurs. In MC3T3-E1 cells, serum-containing LWDH significantly increases in cell viability and osteoblastic differentiation capability. The expression of alpha-SMA, vimentin, KDM7A, Wnt1 and beta-catenin were significantly down-regulated, and the E-cadherin, H3K9-Me2, H3K27-Me2, BMP-4, BMP-7, Runx2, osteocalcin, and Col1a1 were significantly up-regulated with LWDH treatment. The present study shows that LWDH has a therapeutic effect on DNOP, in part, through down-regulation of KDM7A and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

30564125|t|DiDang Tang Inhibits Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Apoptosis Induced by Oxygen Glucose Deprivation and Intracerebral Hemorrhage Through Blockade of the GRP78-IRE1/PERK Pathways.
30564125|a|DiDang Tang (DDT), a Chinese traditional medicine formula, contains 4 Chinese traditional medicine substances, has been widely used to treat intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients. However, the molecular mechanisms of DDT for protecting neurons from oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis after ICH still remains elusive. In this study, high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint analysis was performed to learn the features of the chemical compositions of DDT. OGD-induced ER stress, Ca(2+) overload, and mitochondrial apoptosis were investigated in nerve growth factor -induced PC12, primary neuronal cells, and ICH rats to evaluate the protective effect of DDT. We found that DDT treatment protected neurons against OGD-induced damage and apoptosis by increasing cell viability and reducing the release of lactate dehydrogenase. DDT decreased OGD-induced Ca(2+) overload and ER stress through the blockade of the glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)- inositol-requiring protein 1alpha (IRE1)/ protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) pathways and also inhibited apoptosis by decreasing mitochondrial damage. Moreover, we observed similar findings when we studied DDT for inhibition of ER stress in a rat model of ICH. In addition, our experiments further confirmed the neuroprotective potential of DDT against tunicamycin (TM)-induced neural damage. Our in vitro and in vivo results indicated that the neuroprotective effect of DDT against ER stress damage and apoptosis occurred mainly by blocking the GPR78-IRE1/PERK pathways. Taken together, it provides reliable experimental evidence and explains the molecular mechanism of DDT for the treatment of patients with ICH.

24910405|t|Comparative pharmacokinetic investigation on baicalin and wogonoside in type 2 diabetic and normal rats after oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine Huanglian Jiedu decoction.
24910405|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD) is used traditionally in China for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in clinical practice, which has been proved to be effective. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic characteristics (especially the area under the curve, AUC) of baicalin and wogonoside in type 2 diabetic rats after oral administration of HLJDD extract and to explore its possible mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HLJDD extract and Radix scutellariae extract were prepared and the contents of baicalin and wogonoside contained in two extracts were assayed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Type 2 diabetic rats were induced by high fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Pharmacokinetics of baicalin and wogonoside in type 2 diabetic and normal control rats after oral administration of HLJDD extract or Radix scutellariae extract were investigated. Pharmacokinetics of baicalin in type 2 diabetic and normal rats after oral administration of pure baicalin was also investigated. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic parameters (especially AUCs) of baicalin and wogonoside in type 2 diabetic rats after oral administration of HLJDD extract were remarkably different from those in normal rats. And the alterations of the AUCs of baicalin and wogonoside in type 2 diabetic rats after oral administration of Radix scutellariae extract were similar to those after oral administration of HLJDD extract. Moreover, the increase of the AUC of baicalin in type 2 diabetic rats after oral administration of pure baicalin was similar to that after oral administration of HLJDD extract or Radix scutellariae extract. CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetic behaviors of baicalin and wogonoside (especially the systemic exposure [AUCs] of baicalin and wogonoside) were significantly altered in type 2 diabetic rats after orally administrated HLJDD extract. And the increased AUCs of baicalin and wogonoside in type 2 diabetic rats after oral administration of HLJDD extract resulted from neither the effects of other herbs contained in HLJDD nor the effects of other components contained in Radix scutellariae. It might result from the effects of the pathological status of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

29950994|t|UPLC/Q-TOFMS-Based Metabolomics Approach to Reveal the Protective Role of Other Herbs in An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan Against the Hepatorenal Toxicity of Cinnabar and Realgar.
29950994|a|An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan (AGNH) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) recipe containing cinnabar (HgS) and realgar (As2S2). However, the application of AGNH is limited by the hepato- and nephrotoxicity of cinnabar and realgar. It should be noted that cinnabar and realgar in AGNH are not used alone, but rather combined with other herbs as formula to use. In this study, the protective effects and mechanisms of the other herbs in AGNH against the hepatorenal toxicity induced by cinnabar and realgar were investigated. The combination use of the other herbs in AGNH alleviated inflammatory cell infiltration and damage in the liver and kidney and restored the disturbed serum metabolic profile induced by cinnabar and realgar insults. By UPLC/Q-TOFMS combined with pattern recognition approaches, we identified 41 endogenous metabolites in the sera of mice that were related to the hepatorenal toxicity of cinnabar and realgar, 36 of which were restored to normal levels when various kinds of herbs were combined as compound recipe. These metabolites function as modulators in inflammation-associated glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, sphingolipid, and ether lipid metabolic pathways. Notably, lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs) were the most elevated among all of the metabolites detected after cinnabar and realgar treatment, while these LysoPCs did not show overt differences between the AGNH and saline control groups, which was associated with relatively unaffected or even up-regulated expression of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) and autotaxin (ATX). These findings indicated that other herbs in AGNH could have a protective effect against cinnabar- and realgar-induced hepatic and renal damage via modulating the disordered homeostasis of the glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, ether lipid, and sphingolipid metabolism.

34257680|t|The Herbal Formula Granule Prescription Mahuang Decoction Ameliorated Chronic Kidney Disease Which Was Associated with Restoration of Dysbiosis of Intestinal Microbiota in Rats.
34257680|a|Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a global health issue, and there is increasing evidence showing the beneficial roles of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in CKD treatment. Here, we studied the renoprotective role of Mahuang decoction, a famous TCM prescription, in a rat CKD model induced with the combination of doxorubicin and adenine. Our data showed that intragastric administration of Mahuang decoction inhibited the loss of bodyweight and attenuated proteinuria, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen in CKD rats. Kidney histological analysis revealed decreased tubulointerstitial injury and fibrosis in CKD rats treated with Mahuang decoction accompanied with suppressed expression of TGF-beta1 and phosphorylated NF-kappaB/P65 (p-P65) as indicated by immunohistochemistry. ELISA analysis demonstrated reduced serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNFalpha and IL-6. Most importantly, intestinal microbiota analysis by 16s rRNA-seq showed that Mahuang decoction restored the impaired richness and diversity of intestinal microflora and recovered the disrupted microbial community through reducing the abundance of deleterious microbes and promoting the expansion of beneficial microbes in CKD rats. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that Mahuang decoction mitigated kidney functional and structural impairment in CKD rats which were associated with the restoration of dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota, implying its potential in clinical CKD treatment.

29710529|t|Xihuang pill promotes apoptosis of Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment in 4T1 mouse breast cancer by upregulating MEKK1/SEK1/JNK1/AP-1 pathway.
29710529|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of the MEKK1/SEK1/JNK1/AP-1 pathway in the action of Xihuang pill (XHP) in reducing regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers in the tumor microenvironment in a 4T1 mouse breast cancer model, and to clarify the anti-tumor mechanism of XHP in breast cancer. METHODS: We established a mouse 4T1 breast cancer model. Model mice were administered XHP for 2 weeks, and tumor tissues were then removed, weighed, sliced, and homogenized. Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment were isolated by magnetic cell sorting and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Treg cell apoptosis was detected by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. mRNA expression levels of MEKK1, SEK1, JNK1, and AP-1 in Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and their protein expression levels were detected by immunofluorescence staining and western blot. RESULTS: Tumor weights were significantly lower in the XHP groups compared with the untreated control group. The overall number of Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment decreased while the number of apoptotic Treg cells increased with increasing doses of XHP. mRNA and protein expression levels of MEKK1, SEK1, JNK1, and AP-1 in Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment increased with increasing doses of XHP. CONCLUSION: XHP might promote Treg cell apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment and further inhibit the tumor growth of 4T1 mouse breast cancer. The mechanism of XHP may be related to upregulation of gene and protein expression of MEKK1, SEK1, JNK1, and AP-1 in Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment.

31354826|t|Simultaneous Determination of Seven Active Components in Rat Plasma by UHPLC-MS/MS and Application to a Quantitative Study after Oral Administration of Huang-Lian Jie-Du Decoction in High Fat-Induced Atherosclerosis Rats.
31354826|a|Huang-Lian Jie-Du decoction (HLJDD) has been used to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease for many years in China. Currently, the determination of effect components in HLJDD is focusing either on the formula or on the extract, while quantification of that in biological samples is scarce, especially simultaneous determination of multicomponent. In this paper, a rapid, specific, and sensitive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and fully validated for the simultaneous determination of seven main active constituents, i.e., baicalin, baicalein, wogonoside, wogonin, berberine, palmatine, jatrorrhizine in rat plasma. The method was also successfully applied to a quantitative study after oral administration of HLJDD at different doses of 1.5, 3, and 6 g/kg body weight to high fat-induced atherosclerosis rats. The analytes were detected by ESI source and multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) using positive scanning mode. The blood was collected from the abdominal aorta of rats at predetermined time and preprepared with icariin and tetrahydropalmatine as internal standards (IS). Sample preparation was achieved by protein precipitation (PPT). The validation parameters (linearity, sensitivity, intra-/interday precision and accuracy, extraction recovery, and matrix effect) were within acceptable ranges, and biological extracts were stable during the entire storing and preparing process. And the result of determination of HLJDD-containing plasma, baicalin, baicalein, wogonoside, and wogonin could be highly detected in a dose-dependent manner while berberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine were determined in a very low level and in a dose-independent mode. Thus, the established method was sensitive enough and successfully applied to the determination of seven effective components in plasma taken from 24 high fat-induced atherosclerosis rats after oral administration of three dosages of HLJDD.

10655725|t|[Clinical evaluation of kampo medication, mainly with wen-pi-tang, on the progression of chronic renal failure].
10655725|a|Previous studies have shown that Kampo (traditional Chinese) prescriptions, mainly Wen-Pi-Tang (Onpi-to, [symbol see: text]), have a useful effect in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). We aimed to examine the long-term effect of Kampo prescriptions on serum creatinine (Cr) among patients with CRF. Patients with serum Cr levels of 2 mg/dl more were enrolled if they had at least 4 recordings of serum Cr in the previous 6 months or more, and were followed-up until the start of dialysis. Eight patients aged 24-59 years with serum Cr 4.5 mg/dl were enrolled in the study for 40 to 402 weeks (mean; 228.1 +/- 118.8 weeks). The cause of CRF was chronic glomerulonephritis in 7 patients and systemic lupus erythematosus in 1 patient. The end points of the study were the slope of the reciprocal of the serum Cr concentration plot against time using Mitch's method, and the predicted period of pre-dialysis. The predicted pre-dialysis period was defined as an increase in serum Cr by 10 mg/dl. As a result, the individual slopes were improved in 6 of 8 cases, in particular, in 4 of 5 Wen-Pi Tang-treated cases. The average slope was improved significantly (p < 0.01) in Wen-Pi-Tang-treated cases, although it showed only a tendency to improve in all 8 cases. The predicted pre-dialysis period was prolonged from 79.2 +/- 74.8 weeks to 389.5 +/- 355.4 weeks and 55.6 +/- 37.0 weeks to 262.4 +/- 145.8 weeks in all 8 cases and Wen-Pi-Tang-treated cases, respectively. The observed pre-dialysis period was 228.1 +/- 118.8 weeks, which showed that Kampo prescriptions prolonged the predicted period for 186 additional weeks. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the Kampo prescriptions, consisting mainly of Wen-Pi-Tang, retarded the progression of CRF.

35190749|t|Effect of Shenling Baizhu San on Intestinal Flora in a Rat Model of Ulcerative Colitis with Spleen Deficiency and Dampness.
35190749|a|OBJECTIVE: Shenling Baizhu San (SLBZS) is reported as an effective drug for ulcerative colitis (UC); however, its effect on intestinal flora remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of SLBZS on intestinal flora in a rat model of UC with spleen deficiency and dampness. METHODS: UC was induced in rats using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid on the basis of a model of spleen deficiency and dampness. The 16S rDNA sequencing was used to detect structural changes in the intestinal flora; the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved state (PICRUSt) analysis was used to predict the altered pathways. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, rats in the SLBZS group exhibited decreased levels of TNF-alpha(P < 0.05), and increased abundance and diversity of the intestinal flora. The abundance of Actinobacteria (P < 0.001) and Bacteroides (P < 0.01) increased and that of Firmicutes decreased (P < 0.001), and the abundance of Bifidobacterium(P < 0.05) and Allobaculum increased. PICRUSt analysis showed that the altered pathways between the groups were those of fatty acid and antibiotic biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway. CONCLUSIONS: SLBZS can regulate the structure and function of the intestinal flora, alter expression levels of certain metabolic pathways, and has the potential to treat UC.

11477825|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the level of acute phase protein level (APP) synthesized in hepatocytes in pathogenic process of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and the effect of Dachengqi Decoction (DCQD) on it. METHODS: The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP), alpha 1-antitrypsin total (alpha 1-AT), alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2-MG), ceruloplasmine (Cp), hepatoglobin (Hp) and transferrin (Tf) synthesis were determined in 32 cases of MODS patients and rat models of MODS induced by acute infective peritonitis and mesenterial artery ischemia-reperfusion. RESULTS: The serum APP level in MODS patients was increased and higher than that in the control group (P < 0.01). After 3 days of DCQD treatment, it reduced significantly (P < 0.05). Serum APP level in MODS model was also increased significantly, and after 3 days of DCQD treatment, it reduced significantly (P < 0.05). The APP secreting level of rat hepatocytes cultured in vitro raised after stimulated and activated by lipopolysacchride, which was reduced after cultured with rabbits' serum containing different concentration of effective ingredients of DCQD. The APP inhibiting effect of DCQD was dose dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Purgation therapy with DCQD could reduce the stimulation of pathogenic factors on hepatocytes, protect the tissues and organs from injury caused by excessive inflammatory reaction.

26691002|t|Actions of Huangqi decoction against rat liver fibrosis: a gene expression profiling analysis.
26691002|a|BACKGROUND: Huangqi decoction (HQD) is used for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis treatment in Chinese medicine. This study aims to investigate the pharmacological actions of HQD against liver fibrosis in rats by high-throughput gene expression profiling, network analysis and real-time qRT-PCR. METHODS: We analyzed the profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver fibrosis in rat. The liver tissue samples of control group (n = 3), model group (n = 3) and HQD group (n = 3) were examined by microarrays. Pathways were analyzed by KEGG. Pathway-gene and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed with Cytoscape software. The expression of candidate genes was verified by qRT-PCR. P values less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: Collagen deposition and hydroxyproline (Hyp) content were decreased in the HQD group compared with the model group (P < 0.001), while that of Hyp in the model group were increased compared with the control group (P < 0.001). In comparison with the model group, 1085 DEGs (all P < 0.05, |fold change| >1.5) and 52 pathways in the HQD group were identified. TGF-beta, ECM-receptor interaction, and the cell adhesion molecules pathways were significantly recovered by HQD (P < 0.001). A pathway-gene network was constructed, including 303 DEGs and 52 pathways, and 514 nodes and 2602 edges, among 142 genes with node degrees greater than 10. The expressions of PDGFra, PDGFrb, PDGFb, PDGFd, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL5A2, and THBS1 were significantly down-regulated by HQD (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: HQD down-regulated the expressions of PDGFra, PDGFrb, PDGFb, PDGFd, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL5A2 and THBS1, and TGF-beta and PDGF signaling pathways in the DMN-induced liver fibrosis in rats.

33906674|t|Potential mechanisms of Guizhi decoction against hypertension based on network pharmacology and Dahl salt-sensitive rat model.
33906674|a|BACKGROUND: Guizhi decoction (GZD), a classical Chinese herbal formula, has been widely used to treat hypertension, but its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The present study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms and therapeutic effects of GZD on hypertension by integrating network pharmacology and experimental validation. METHODS: The active ingredients and corresponding targets were collected from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). The targets related to hypertension were identified from the CTD, GeneCards, OMIM and Drugbank databases. Multiple networks were constructed to identify the key compounds, hub targets, and main biological processes and pathways of GZD against hypertension. The Surflex-Dock software was used to validate the binding affinity between key targets and their corresponding active compounds. The Dahl salt-sensitive rat model was used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of GZD against hypertension. RESULTS: A total of 112 active ingredients, 222 targets of GZD and 341 hypertension-related targets were obtained. Furthermore, 56 overlapping targets were identified, five of which were determined as the hub targets for experimental verification, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2), IL-1beta, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9. Pathway enrichment analysis results indicated that 56 overlapping targets were mainly enriched in several inflammation pathways such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. Molecular docking confirmed that most active compounds of GZD could bind tightly to the key targets. Experimental studies revealed that the administration of GZD improved blood pressure, reduced the area of cardiac fibrosis, and inhibited the expression of IL-6, CCL2, IL-1beta, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in rats. CONCLUSION: The potential mechanisms and therapeutic effects of GZD on hypertension may be attributed to the regulation of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis.

31885903|t|Taohong Siwu Decoction Exerts a Beneficial Effect on Cardiac Function by Possibly Improving the Microenvironment and Decreasing Mitochondrial Fission after Myocardial Infarction.
31885903|a|Cardiovascular disease has been established as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, resulting in a huge burden to patients, families, and society. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents several advantages for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases including multitargets, multi-ingredients, fewer side effects, and low cost. In this study, a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI) was established by ligating the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery, and the effect of the Taohong Siwu decoction (THSWD) on cardiac function was evaluated in MI rats. Following the intragastric administration of THSWD, the cardiac function was examined using echocardiography. The infarct size and collagen deposition in the infarct area were measured using Masson's trichrome staining, and the number of CD31- and alpha-SMA-positive blood vessels in the peri-infarct and infarct area was evaluated by immunofluorescent staining. The mRNA expression of bFGF, IGF-1, and HGF was detected using RT-PCR assay. Cell apoptosis in the infarcted area was assessed by TUNEL staining, and the p-Akt level was detected using the western blot assay. The mitochondrial ROS production was measured using MitoSOX staining, and mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy were evaluated with western blotting 7 days after THSWD treatment. THSWD increased the ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) values in the rat hearts; however, no statistical difference was found between the THSWD and MI groups 4 weeks after treatment. Furthermore, THSWD significantly decreased the value of the left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV). Compared with the model group, THSWD significantly increased the expression of IGF-1 and bFGF, reduced collagen deposition, promoted angiogenesis, reduced cell apoptosis, and activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Notably, THSWD significantly decreased mitochondrial ROS production and Fis1 expression. No statistical differences were observed in the expression of mitochondrial LC3B and Mfn1 between the THSWD and control groups. In summary, THSWD may possess a beneficial effect on cardiac function by improving the local ischemic microenvironment and by decreasing mitochondrial fission after MI. Hence, this may present a promising auxiliary strategy in the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy such as MI.

28480435|t|THE HERBAL MIXTURE XIAO-CHAI-HU TANG (XCHT) INDUCES APOPTOSIS OF HUMAN HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA HUH7 CELLS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO.
28480435|a|BACKGROUND: Xiao-Chai-Hu Tang (XCHT) is an extract of seven herbs with anticancer properties, but its mechanism of action is unknown. In this study, we evaluated XCHT-treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a hepatic cancer xenograft model, we investigated the in vivo efficacy of XCHT against tumor growth by evaluating tumor volume and weight, as well as measuring apoptosis and cellular proliferation within the tumor. To study the effects of XCHT in vitro, we measured the cell viability of XCHT-treated Huh7 cells, as well as colony formation and apoptosis. To identify a potential mechanism of action, the gene and protein expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, CDK4 and cyclin-D1 were measured in XCHT-treated Huh7 cells. RESULTS: We found that XCHT reduced tumor size and weight, as well as significantly decreased cell viability both in vivo and in vitro. XCHT suppressed the expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 in HCC tissues and inhibited Huh7 colony formation. XCHT induced apoptosis in HCC tumor tissues and in Huh7 cells. Finally, XCHT altered the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, CDK4 and cyclin-D1, which halted cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that XCHT enhances expression of pro-apoptotic pathways, resulting in potent anticancer activity.

34040394|t|Banxia Xiexin Decoction Inhibits the Expression of PD-L1 Through Multi-Target and Multi-Pathway Regulation of Major Oncogenes in Gastric Cancer.
34040394|a|PURPOSE: Banxia xiexin decoction (BXXX) is a classical Chinese herbal compound for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Its ingredients are also considered helpful for cancer rehabilitation. Here, we will explore the regulatory mechanism of BXXX acting on PD-L1 in gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: GC samples and the general baseline data of the patients were collated. Immunohistochemical (IHC) detected the expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1(PD-L1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), interferon-gamma receptor (IFNGR) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). ELISA detected the expressions of EGF, IFNG and IL-6 in serum samples. Network tools were used to analyze the potential molecules of BXXX. In the cell experiment, CCK-8 detected the cell proliferation. Tunel detected the apoptosis. Western blot detected the expression of related proteins. In animal experiments, the tumor volume of GC-bearing mice was observed. Expression of EGF, IFNG and IL-6 in the serum of tumor-bearing GC mice were detected by ELISA. Western blot detected the expression of related proteins. RESULTS: The expressions of PD-L1, HIF-1, EGFR, IFNGR and TLR4 in the tissues of GC patients were significantly increased, and the expressions of EGF, IFNG and IL-6 in serum were increased. The molecular results of the network tools showed that BXXX and its main components have a targeting effect on the key molecules of each pathway in the PD-L1 regulatory network. Cell experiments showed that BXXX can inhibit the expression of PD-L1, HIF-1, EGFR and TLR4, but has no significant effect on the expression of IFNGR, thus inhibiting the proliferation and promoting the apoptosis of GC cells. The results were consistent with the animal experiments on tumor-bearing gastric cancer mice. CONCLUSION: BXXX inhibited the expression of PD-L1 through multi-target and multi-pathway regulation of major oncogenes in GC, thus effect cell proliferation and apoptosis.

30901663|t|Network analysis and mechanisms of action of Chinese herb-related natural compounds in lung cancer cells.
30901663|a|BACKGROUND: Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are a resource of natural compounds (ingredients) and their potential chemical derivatives with anticancer properties, some of which are already in clinical use. Bei-Mu (BM), Jie-Geng (JG), and Mai-Men-Dong-Tang (MMDT) are important CHMs prescribed for patients with lung cancer that have improved the survival rate. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to systemically investigate the mechanisms of action of these CHM products in lung cancer cells. METHODS: We used a network pharmacology approach to study CHM product-related natural compounds and their lung cancer targets. In addition, the underlying anti-lung cancer effects of the natural compounds on apoptosis, cell cycle progression, autophagy, and the expression of related proteins was investigated in vitro. RESULTS: Ingredient-lung cancer target network analysis identified 20 natural compounds. Three of these compounds, ursolic acid, 2-(3R)-8,8-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano(6,5-f)chromen-3-yl)-5-methoxyphenol, and licochalcone A, inhibited the proliferation of A549 lung cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Signal pathway analyses suggested that these three ingredients may target cellular apoptosis, anti-apoptosis, and cell cycle-related proteins. These three ingredients induced apoptosis through the regulation of the expression of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, including B-cell lymphoma-2 and full-length and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase proteins. They also induced cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M phases and autophagy in A549 cells. CONCLUSION: The pharmacological mechanisms of ingredients from MMDT on lung cancer may be strongly associated with their modulatory effects on apoptosis, autophagy, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation.

10030725|t|Inhibitory effects of Dai-saiko-to (Da-Chai-Hu-Tang) on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in Kurosawa and Kusanagi-hypercholesterolemic rabbits.
10030725|a|The inhibitory effects of the traditional herbal medicine Dai-saiko-to (Da-Chai-Hu-Tang) on the progression of the atherosclerotic lesions were studied using the spontaneous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) model, Kurosawa and Kusanagi-hypercholesterolemic (KHC) rabbits. Changes in blood chemistry, pathology and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation were measured in a control group and a Dai-saiko-to-treated group. In the control group, the area of atheromatous plaques of the aorta progressed between week 12 (29.1%) and 26 (51.5%). This progression of atherosclerotic lesions did not happen in the Dai-saiko-to-treated group between week 12 (26%) and 26 (27.4%). Antioxidative effects on LDL were seen in the Dai-saiko-to-treated group in weeks 16 and 18. Dai-saiko-to did not improve the hypercholesterolemia in the KHC rabbits. These results suggest that Dai-saiko-to has inhibitory effects on the development of atheromatous plaque formation in spontaneous FH model rabbits. It is possible that the antioxidative effects of Dai-saiko-to on LDL led to the beneficial effects observed in this study.

27493835|t|Danggui-Shaoyao-San: New Hope for Alzheimer's Disease.
27493835|a|Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS), also called Toki-shakuyaku-san (TJ-23) or Dangguijakyak-san (DJS), is a well-known herbal formula (Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels., Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort., Paeonia lactiflora pall., Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf, Alisma orientalis (Sam.) Juzep., Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.), which has been widely used in oriental countries for the treatment of various gynecological diseases. Recent studies show that DSS has an effect on free radical-mediated neurological diseases and exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities and reduces cell apoptosis in the hippocampus. In addition, DSS mediates the modulation of central monoamine neurotransmitter systems and ameliorates dysfunction of the central cholinergic nervous system and scopolamine-induced decrease in ACh levels. DSS improves the function of the dopaminergic, adrenergic, and serotonergic nervous systems. Interestingly, DSS can alleviate cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, suggesting that it is a useful therapeutic agent for AD. This paper reviews the mechanism of DSS for the treatment of AD.

The concentration of serum cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), the peripheral blood cell counts of total lymphocyte, T-lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and T lymphocyte subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8) as well as the levels of IgA, IgG, IGM and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on the day before operation, the first morning after operation and at the end of study. RESULTS: At the end of the study, the concentration of IgA, IgG, 1gM, number of total lymphocyte, CD3, CD4 and CD4 lCD8, and serum IL-2 were obviously higher (P < 0.05), and levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha and CRP were obviously lower in the tested group than those in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Early application of SJZD on the base of enteral nutritional therapy can lessen the degree of post-operational stress and inflammatory response, and enhance the immune function of patients.

30187871|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe effects of Biejiajian Pills on hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cell vasculogenic mimicry (VM) and explore the molecular mechanism by which Biejiajian Pills inhibits HCC metastasis and invasion. METHODS: Forty male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups for gastric lavage of normal saline or high, moderate or low doses of Biejiajian Pills (twice daily) for 4 consecutive days. The sera were collected from the rats for treatment of cultured human HCC HepG2 cells. VM formation in the cells was detected using an image acquisition and analysis system 24 h after incubation of the cells with the sera and with the RhoA/ROCK inhibitor Y-27632(P). The expression levels of RhoA and ROCK1 in the cells were detected using Western blotting, and the contents of VE-cadherin and PI3K in the culture supernatant were determined using ELISA. RESULTS: Treatment with the sera from Biejiajian Pills-treated rats significantly inhibited formation of VM in HepG2 cells, and the diameters of VM formed were significantly greater than those in the positive control group (P < 0.01). Y-27632 completely inhibited the formation of VM in HepG2 cells (P < 0.01). Treatments with Biejiajian Pills and Y-27632 both inhibited the expression of RhoA and ROCK1 (P < 0.05) and significantly lowered the contents of VE-cadherin and PI3K in the culture supernatant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Biejiajian Pills can inhibit the formation of VM in HCC cells in vitro possibly by inhibiting the RhoA/ROCK pathways and the expressions of VE-cadherin and PI3K.

28865366|t|Buyanghuanwu Decoction alleviated pressure overload induced cardiac remodeling by suppressing Tgf-beta/Smads and MAPKs signaling activated fibrosis.
28865366|a|Buyanghuanwu Decoction (BHD), a traditional Chinese medicine recipe, is a representative prescription for the treatment of qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome. In this study, the effect of BHD on pressure overload induced cardiac remodeling was investigated and possible mechanism underlying was explored. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham, transverse aorta constriction (TAC) with saline, TAC with telmisartan (TAC+Tel), and TAC with BHD (TAC+BHD) for 16 weeks (n=6 approximately 8 in each group). Cardiac morphological and functional changes were evaluated by echocardiography and histological methods, the molecular alterations were detected by western blotting. Our results revealed that pressure overload prominently induced cardiac dysfunction, dilated and atrophied left ventricle, decreased cardiomyocyte cross sectional area, and fibrosis. However, BHD, similar to Tel, greatly reversed cardiac dysfunction, left ventricular dilation, and fibrosis, together with increased left ventricular wall thickness and size of cardiomyocyte. Furthermore, activated classical pro-fibrotic signaling of Tgf-beta/Smads and MAPKs after TAC was dramatically suppressed by BHD or Tel treatment. Taken together, it was demonstrated in this study that BHD exerted a cardioprotective effect against pressure overload induced cardiac remodeling via inactivation of Tgf-beta/Smads and MAPKs signaling triggered fibrosis.

29410309|t|Gastroprotective effects of Hwanglyeonhaedok-tang against Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric cell injury.
29410309|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Helicobacter pylori, which is found in the stomachs of approximately half of the world's population, has been associated with the development of chronic gastritis and gastric cancer. Hwanglyeonhaedok-tang (HHT) is a popular traditional medicine for the therapies of gastric ulcers and gastritis. AIM OF THE STUDY: The emerging resistance of H. pylori to antibiotics arouses requirement on alternative nonantibiotic-based therapies. In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory activity and anti-microbial activity of HHT against H. pylori in vitro and in an H. pylori-infected mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H. pylori were treated with various concentrations of HHT and then incubated with human gastric carcinoma AGS cells. For the in vivo study, mice were orally infected with H. pylori three times over the course of 1 week, and then subjected to daily administration of HHT (120 or 600mg/kg) for 4 weeks or standard triple therapy for 1 week. At the scheduled termination of the experiment, all mice were killed and their stomachs were collected for histological examination, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Our in vitro studies showed that HHT treatment inhibited the adhesion of H. pylori to AGS cells and suppressed the H. pylori-induced increases of inflammatory regulators, such as interleukin (IL)-8, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In the mouse model, HHT treatment significantly reduced H. pylori colonization, inflammation, and the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), COX-2, and iNOS in gastric mucosa. Further investigation showed that HHT treatment reduced the H. pylori-induced phosphorylations of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings collectively suggest that HHT has anti-inflammatory activity and antibacterial activity against H. pylori and could be an alternative to antibiotics for preventing H. pylori infection.

26850724|t|Chinese herbal medicine Xiaoji decoction inhibited growth of lung cancer cells through AMPKalpha-mediated inhibition of Sp1 and DNA methyltransferase 1.
26850724|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiaoji decoction (XJD), which was considered as a Chinese herbal prescription, has been used for cancer treatment, especially lung cancer, for decades to improve quality of life and prolong the patient survival. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential have not been well elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cell viability was examined by MTT assays. The phosphorylation and expression of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and transcription factor Sp1 proteins were assessed by Western Blot. Exogenous expression of Sp1 and DNMT1 were performed by transient transfection methods. The effects of XJD on the growth of xenograft tumors were evaluated by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. RESULTS: We showed that XJD inhibited growth of human non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro. We also found that XJD increased phosphorylation of AMPKalpha and inhibited protein expression of DNTM1, the latter was not observed in the presence of the inhibitor of AMPK (compound C). Overexpression of DNTM1 reversed the effect of XJD on cell growth. In addition, XJD decreased Sp1 protein expression, which was eliminated by compound C. Conversely, exogenous expressed Sp1 abrogated XJD-inhibited DNTM1 protein expression. Interestingly, exogenous expression of DNMT1 feedback antagonized the XJD-induced phosphorylation of AMPKalpha. In in vivo studies, we found that XJD inhibited tumor growth in xenograft nude mice model, which was accompanied by induction of phosphorylation of AMPKalpha and suppression of DNMT1 protein from xenograft tumors. CONCLUSION: Our results show that XJD inhibits NSCLC cell growth via AMPKalpha-mediated inhibition of transcription of Sp1, followed by the reduction of DNMT1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. The negative feedback regulation loop of AMPKalpha further demonstrates the critical role of DNMT1 in mediating the overall effects of XJD in this process. This study unveils novel molecular mechanism by which XJD controls NSCLC cell growth.

25887351|t|Chlorpromazine-induced perturbations of bile acids and free fatty acids in cholestatic liver injury prevented by the Chinese herbal compound Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang.
25887351|a|BACKGROUNDS: Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang (YCHT), a commonly used as a traditional chinese medicine for liver disease. Several studies indicated that YCHT may improving hepatic triglyceride metabolism and anti-apoptotic response as well as decreasing oxidative stress .However, little is known about the role of YCHT in chlorpromazine (CPZ) -induced chlolestatic liver injury. Therefore, we aimed to facilitate the understanding of the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury and evaluate the effect of Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang (YCHT) on chlorpromazine (CPZ)-induced cholestatic liver injury in rats based on the change of bile acids (BAs) and free fatty acids (FFAs) alone with the biochemical indicators and histological examination. METHODS: We conducted an experiment on CPZ-induced cholestatic liver injury in Wistar rats with and without YCHT for nine consecutive days. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), total bilirubin (TBIL), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured to evaluate the protective effect of YCHT against chlorpromazine (CPZ)-induced cholestatic liver injury. Histopathology of the liver tissue showed that pathological injuries were relieved after YCHT pretreatment. In addition, ultra-performance lipid chromatography coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to determine the content of bile acids, free fatty acids, respectively. RESULTS: Obtained data showed that YCHT attenuated the effect of CPZ-induced cholestatic liver injury, which was manifested by the serum biochemical parameters and histopathology of the liver tissue. YCHT regulated the lipid levels as indicated by the reversed serum levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C. YCHT also regulated the disorder of BA and FFA metabolism by CPZ induction. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that YCHT exerted a protective effect on CPZ-induced cholestasis liver injury. The variance of BA and FFA concentrations can be used to evaluate the cholestatic liver injury caused by CPZ and the hepatoprotective effect of YCHT.

33628305|t|Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Sosiho-Tang, a Traditional Herbal Formula, on Acute Lung Injury in LPS-Sensitized Mice and -Raw 264.7 Cells.
33628305|a|Acute lung injury (ALI) is a series of syndromes with persistent inflammation and abnormally increased vascular permeability. Sosiho-tang (SSHT), a traditional herbal formula consisting of a mixture of seven herbs, has been used to treat allergic reactions and chronic hepatitis disease in East Asia. In this study, we determined whether SSHT has an inhibitory effect against lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. 0.05, 0.55, and 5.55 mg/kg of SSHT were orally administered to C57BL/6J mice for 7 days prior to the administration of LPS. After 2 h of LPS sensitization, lung tissues were collected to confirm the lung histology and ALI-related inflammatory factors. SSHT ameliorated the LPS-induced alveolar hemorrhage, alveolar wall thickening, and the shrinkage of the alveolar spaces in the ALI mice model. Proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma in the lung tissue were significantly regulated in the SSHT-treated groups compared to the LPS only-treated group. Also, increases of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and decrease of IFN-gamma expressions were dose-dependently modulated by SSHT treatment in LPS-induced raw 264.7 cells. Additionally, the translocation of NF-kappaB into nucleus and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were significantly attenuated by the treatment of SSHT in LPS-sensitized ALI mice. SSHT showed anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and NF-kappaB signaling in LPS-induced ALI. This study demonstrates that SSHT has preventive effects on LPS-induced ALI by regulating inflammatory responses as an alternative for treating lung diseases.

35068345|a|Wuling Decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used to open knots, benefit water, transform Qi, return fluid, and has a significant effect on strengthening the spleen and removing dampness. To explore the effects of Wuling Decoction on the intestinal tract and aquaporin in Adriamycin-induced nephropathy, 45 specific pathogen free (SPF) Wistar rats were randomly divided into a blank control group (5 rats), Dosing control group (10 rats), Adriamycin nephropathy model group (10 rats), diarrhea group (10 rats), and an Adriamycin nephropathy diarrhea model group (10 rats). The tissue localization of aquaporin (AQP) was determined by immunohistochemistry. The expression of AQP mRNA and protein was measured by RT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The results indicated that Wuling Decoction causes excretion of AQP2 through the urine, regulates AQP2 levels, and exerts diuretic and anti-diarrheal effects. It also regulates the levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), affects water absorption rate, and reduces the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in each tissue, thus reducing the absorption of AQP2 to water. Wuling Decoction promoted AQP2 expression in the nephropathy model group and inhibited AQP2 expression in the diarrhea group. Wuling Decoction increased the expression of aquaporin in the intestinal tract, reduced the water content of stool by promoting the absorption of water in the intestinal tract, inhibited the expression of aquaporin and its regulatory factors in nephridia tissue, and reduced the reabsorption of water to increase urine volume, to decrease the occurrence of diarrhea.

18567089|t|Treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome in severe acute pancreatitis patients with traditional Chinese medicine.
18567089|a|AIM: To investigate the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese traditional medicines Da Cheng Qi Decoction (Timely-Purging and Yin-Preserving Decoction) and Glauber's salt combined with conservative measures on abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients. METHODS: Eighty consecutive SAP patients, admitted for routine non-operative conservative treatment, were randomly divided into study group and control group (40 patients in each group). Patients in the study group received Da Cheng Qi Decoction enema for 2 h and external use of Glauber's salt, once a day for 7 d. Patients in the control group received normal saline (NS) enema. Routine non-operative conservative treatments included non-per os nutrition (NPON), gastrointestinal decompression, life support, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), continuous peripancreatic vascular pharmaceutical infusion and drug therapy. Intra-cystic pressure (ICP) of the two groups was measured during treatment. The effectiveness and outcomes of treatment were observed and APACHE II scores were applied in analysis. RESULTS: On days 4 and 5 of treatment, the ICP was lower in the study group than in the control group (P < 0.05). On days 3-5 of treatment, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores for the study and control groups were significantly different (P < 0.05). Both the effectiveness and outcome of the treatment with Da Cheng Qi Decoction on abdominalgia, burbulence relief time, ascites quantity, cyst formation rate and hospitalization time were quite different between the two groups (P < 0.05). The mortality rate for the two groups had no significant difference. CONCLUSION: Da Cheng Qi Decoction enema and external use of Glauber's salt combined with routine non-operative conservative treatment can decrease the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of SAP patients and have preventive and therapeutic effects on abdominal compartment syndrome of SAP.

28142118|t|Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang ameliorates coronary artery ligation-induced myocardial ischemia in rats.
28142118|a|Dang The present study was designed to investigate cardioprotective effects of Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang (DGBUT) on coronary artery ligation-induced myocardial ischemia. Myocardial ischemia (MI) model was induced in SD rats by surgical ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. ST segment elevation of Electrocardiograph (ECG) infarct size, levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT), catalase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, p38, c-Jun NH2 terminal kinases (JNK), nuclear factor (NF)-kappaBp65, inhibitory kappa B (IkappaB) alpha, IkappaB kinase (IKK) alpha and IKKbeta were evaluated in rats treated with or without DGBUT. DGBUT treatment significantly reduced the elevation of the ST segment of ECG, the myocardial infarct size of MI. The level of LDH, CK and MDA were suppressed, the contents of SOD, GSH and CAT were enhanced with DGBUT. The elevated concentration of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6 in MI rats were effectively reversed by the DGBUT administration. Also, highly expressed p-JNK, p-ERK, p-p38, p-NF-kappaBp65, p-IkappaBalpha, p-IKKalpha and p-IKKbeta in MI rats were restored respectively by DGBUT treatment. The protective effect of DGBUT against MI injury might be associated with MAPK/NF-small ka, CyrillicB pathway.

17048670|t|[The nephrotoxicity in rats caused by Longdan Xiegan decoction].
17048670|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the renal injury in rats induced by Longdan Xiegan decoction (LDXGD) containing different dosages Aristolochia manshriensis. METHOD: SD rats were divided into four groups at random, and were fed with three kinds of LDXGD 13, 14.5, 17.5 g x kg(-1) (containing respectively A. manshriensis 1.5, 3, 6 g x kg(-1)) and distilled water respectively for 12 weeks. Renal functional parameters on 4,8,12 w were determined and changes of histomorphology in rats on the end of experiment were observed. RESULT: The LDXGD containing low dose (1.5 g x kg(-1)) A. manshriensis did't induce significantly renal injury in rats during 12 weeks; the LDXGD containing midst dose(3 g x kg(-1)) A. manshriensis induced light damage of proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells in rats during 12 weeks; the LDXGD containing high dose(6 g x kg(-1)) A. manshriensis induced significantly renal injury in rats after administed 4 weeks. Along with the lasting of administration, the degree of injury became more seriously. The main renal injury location was in proximal convoluted tubule. CONCLUSION: The renal toxicity of LDXGD is correlated with the dose of A. manshriensis and the time of administration. The LDXGD containing low dose A. manshriensis has relative security. However, the LDXGD containing high dose A. manshriensis can induce renal injury.

33657988|t|Efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Combined with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors on the Treatment for Parkinson's Disease with Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
33657988|a|Depression is a common neuropsychiatric symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), resulting in a lower quality of life and cognitive impairment in PD patients. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas have been widely used in neurodegenerative disease and neuropsychic disorders to improve life quality of patients in ethnomedicine. TCM formulas combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) also have a positive effect on depressed PD compared with SSRIs as reported by several clinical studies. However, the results are discordant and failed to be conclusive. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of TCM formulas combined with SSRIs for depressed PD in this systematic review. We searched literatures from PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, and VIP Information Database before July 2020. We included randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of TCM formulas combined with SSRIs on depressed PD patients. This analysis was according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. Eleven randomized clinical trials involving 861 subjects were enrolled in this analysis. The overall results showed that TCM formulas combined with SSRIs significantly improved the depression score [weighted mean difference (WMD): -4.920, 95% confidence interval (CI): (-5.999, -3.840); [Formula: see text] inverted exclamation mark 0.001] and had a statistical significance on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale II score [WMD: -1.209, 95% CI: (-1.561, -0.857); [Formula: see text] < 0.001]. Furthermore, we observed that Chai-Hu-Shu-Gan Powder combined with SSRIs had a significant improvement on the depressive symptom in PD compared to the SSRIs alone [WMD: -5.390, 95% CI: (-7.66, -3.11); [Formula: see text] < 0.001]. No severe side events were reported in these included trials. This systematic review provided the evidences that TCM formulas combined with SSRIs might be helpful and safe in the treatment of depression of PD, including Chai-Hu-Shu-Gan Powder. Also, more randomized double-blinded trials with reliable design are required in the future.

12572385|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular mechanism of effect of Sini Decoction (SND) on myocardial endothelin (MET) in myocardial ischemic rats. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, the normal control group, the ischemia group and the SND group. Myocardial ischemia was produced by pituitrin in the latter two groups. The content, immunohistochemical assay and gene expression of MET-1 were determined in all the three groups and compared. RESULTS: The content of MET in the SND group was significantly lower than that in the ischemia group (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical examination showed that MET-1 was mainly located at the cardiac muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells with the grey scale obviously lower in the ischemia group than that in the control group and the SND group (P < 0.01). While RT-PCR showed that the grey scale of PCR product band in the ischemia group was significantly higher than that in the other two groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: SND could significantly lower MET content, it may be related to the effect of SND in inhibiting MET-1 gene expression and protein synthesis.

29864926|t|Chaihu-shugan san inhibits inflammatory response to improve insulin signaling in liver and prefrontal cortex of CUMS rats with glucose intolerance.
29864926|a|Depression is a mental illness comorbid risk factor for glucose intolerance worldwide. Chaihu-shugan san, a 'Shu-Gan' formula in traditional Chinese medicine, is clinically used in the treatment of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Chaihu-shugan san improved glucose tolerance with its antidepressant activity in rat model of depression and explore the mechanisms underlying its action on liver-brain inflammation axis. After 6 weeks of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) procedure, male Wistar rats were given Chaihu-shugan san water extract (925 and 1850mg/kg) by gavage for the next 6 consecutive weeks. Sucrose consumption test was used to assess animal depressive-like behaviors. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was employed to define the status of glucose tolerance in rats. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) were measured by commercial kits, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expression of key proteins in inflammatory signaling cascades including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-1 (Caspase-1) and IL-1beta, as well as insulin signaling in liver and prefrontal cortex of rats. Immunohistochemical staining or immunofluorescence staining of NF-kappaB, and nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of NF-kappaB by Western blot were used to describe its nuclear entry in liver and prefrontal cortex of rats. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis, as well as microRNA-155 (miR-155) mimic or inhibitor transfection were used to explore possible association of MyD88 and miR-155. In this study, Chaihu-shugan san increased sucrose consumption and reduced serum glucose levels in CUMS rats, showing its antidepressant activity with glucose tolerance improvement. Chaihu-shugan san reduced serum levels of ALT and IL-1beta in this animal model. Furthermore, this formula inhibited hepatic and prefrontal cortical inflammatory response by suppressing TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and improved insulin signaling in CUMS rats. More importantly, Chaihu-shugan san up-regulated miR-155 expression in liver and prefrontal cortex of CUMS rats. These results provide direct evidence that Chaihushugan San can ameliorate depressive-like behaviors by inhibiting liver-brain inflammation axis.

29662375|t|Endocrinological actions of Unkei-to, a herbal medicine, and its clinical usefulness in anovulatory and/or infertile women.
29662375|a|Kampo medicine (Chinese herbal medicine) has been reported to be effective in the treatment of pituitary-ovarian dysfunction in young women and in the treatment of undefined symptoms in perimenopausal women. It has been considered that both the diagnosis and treatment of ovulatory failure in adolescent girls or young women are necessary for the sake of future fertile capacity. However, treatment for the above patients is not easy as steroid hormones and strong stimulators of ovulation should not be recommended because of the several side-effects it causes. Furthermore, young women, especially teenagers, seem to be reluctant to visit gynecology clinics. A number of herbal medicines have been used for many centuries in China and Japan for the treatment of menstrual disorders and infertility. In general, the traditional Chinese herbal prescriptions are rather inexpensive and safe with little side-effects, and have properties for normalizing biological balances. Unkei-to is known to stimulate the synthesis and release of gonadotropins in the rat pituitary. In humans, Unkei-to is known to be effective in various menstrual disorders, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility. In the treatment of ovulatory failure, recent dynamic studies have revealed the mechanism by which Unkei-to stimulates the diencephalon-pituitary-ovarian axis in humans. In this paper, we critically review the clinical data available (to date) in order to assess the efficacy of Unkei-to in inducing ovulation in several types of ovulatory disturbances. (Reprod Med Biol 2003; 2: 45-61).

32023237|t|Use of a Systematic Pharmacological Methodology to Explore the Mechanism of Shengmai Powder in Treating Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.
32023237|a|BACKGROUND Cardiovascular complications, such as diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), are the leading cause of death in diabetic patients. Shengmai Powder (SMP) was found to have cardioprotective effects. MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on the systematic pharmacological methodology, this research determined the genes of DCM and the known targets of SMP, predicted potential compounds and targets of SMP, constructed networks for DCM and SMP, and performed network analysis. RESULTS Five network were constructed: (1) the DCM gene PPI network; (2) the Compound-compound target network of SMP; (3) the SMP-DCM PPI network; (4) the Compound-known target network of SMP; (5) and the SMP known target-DCM PPI network. Several DCM and treatment related targets, clusters, signaling pathways, and biological processes were found. CONCLUSIONS SMP is able to regulate glycometabolism-related, lipid metabolism-related, inflammatory response-related, oxidative stress-related signaling pathways, and biological processes and targets, which suggests that SMP may have a therapeutic effect on DCM.

9824275|t|Inhibitory effects of the herbal medicine Sho-saiko-to (TJ-9) on cell proliferation and procollagen gene expressions in cultured rat hepatic stellate cells.
9824275|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is of extreme importance to prevent liver fibrosis and subsequent progression to liver cirrhosis. The aim of our study was to elucidate in vitro whether Sho-saiko-to exerted inhibitory effects on hepatic stellate cells. METHODS: Hepatic stellate cells were isolated from male Wistar rats. Water-soluble ingredients of Sho-saiko-to were obtained at concentrations of 10, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 microg/ml. Morphological transformation was observed under a phase-contrast microscope. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on day 4 after culture to evaluate the potential to proliferate of the stellate cells by analyzing cell cycles. Northern blot analysis was carried out on day 3 after culture to determine the expressions of type I and type III procollagen mRNAs. RESULTS: (i) Sho-saiko-to 500 and 1000 microg/ml inhibited morphological transformation of the stellate cells to myofibroblast-like cells. (ii) Sho-saiko-to 500 and 1000 microg/ml significantly (p<0.0001) accumulated the cells in the G0/G1 phase (118.8+/-0.7%, 119.2+/-0.5%, respectively as compared with control) and significantly (p<0.0001) decreased cell numbers subsequently in G2/M phase (47.5+/-8.1%, 48.9+/-2.0%, respectively). (iii) Sho-saiko-to 500 and 1000 microg/ml also significantly (p<0.05 or p<0.0001) suppressed procollagen mRNA expression of type I to 51.5+/-6.4%, 34.9+/-3.7%, respectively, and type III to 51.3+/-12.3%, 46.7+/-11.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have clarified the inhibitory effects of Sho-saiko-to on hepatic stellate cells in vitro. Sho-saiko-to could be a potent inhibitor in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.

21682829|t|Therapeutic effects of the oriental herbal medicine Sho-saiko-to on liver cirrhosis and carcinoma.
21682829|a|The traditional Chinese herbal medicine Sho-saiko-to is a mixture of seven herbal preparations that has long been used in the treatment of chronic liver disease. Various clinical trials have shown that Sho-saiko-to protects against the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients. However, the mechanism by which Sho-saiko-to protects hepatocytes against hepatic fibrosis and carcinoma is not yet known. Basic science studies have demonstrated that Sho-saiko-to reduces hepatocyte necrosis and enhances liver function. Sho-saiko-to significantly inhibits hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting the activation of stellate cells, the major producers of collagen in the liver, as well as by inhibiting hepatic lipid peroxidation, promoting matrix degradation, and suppressing extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. Furthermore, clinical trials have shown that Sho-saiko-to lowers the rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with cirrhosis and increases the survival of patients with HCC. Unfortunately, some case reports have shown the side effects of Sho-saiko-to. Most of the side effects were interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory failure induced by Sho-saiko-to in Japan. As a result of analyzing these case reports, the incidence and risk are increased by co-administration of interferon, duration of medication, and, high in an elderly population. This review discusses the properties of Sho-saiko-to with regards to the treatment of chronic liver diseases and suggests the side effects of Sho-saiko-to.

17854556|t|[Effects of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase expression in target tissues of type 2 diabetic rats].
17854556|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HLJDD), a traditional Chinese compound herbal medicine, on p85 mRNA and protein expressions of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K) in target tissues (skeletal muscular and adipose tissues) in rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to investigate the molecular mechanism of HLJDD in treating T2DM. METHODS: The male Wistar rats were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) 30 mg/kg through tail vein, and fed with high-fat and high-caloric diets to induce T2DM. Then the rats were randomly divided into untreated group, aspirin-treated group and HLJDD group, and treated correspondingly. Meanwhile, a group of normal animals without any treatment was set up for normal control group. Ten weeks later, serum fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum fasting insulin (FINS) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were routinely determined. The expressions of PI-3K p85 mRNA and protein in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue were determined with RT-PCR and Western blotting before and after insulin treatment. RESULTS: Compared with the untreated group, the FBG and OGTT levels in T2DM rats treated with HLJDD decreased significantly (P<0.05). The FINS in HLJDD group was lower than that in the normal control group (P<0.05), but was not significantly different from that in the untreated group. The PI-3K p85 mRNA and protein expressions in HLJDD group obviously increased, as compared with those in the untreated group. CONCLUSION: The effect of HLJDD in treating T2DM was probably associated with its improvement of PI-3K p85 mRNA and protein expressions in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of the T2DM rats.

17025223|t|[The effect of Sairei-to on oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization in the neonatal rat].
17025223|a|PURPOSE: To study the effect of Sairei-to (ST), a Japanese traditional medicine, on oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) in rats. METHODS: OIR was induced by maintaining Sprague-Dawley neonatal rats in 80% oxygen for 12 days. The rats were treated once daily with oral administration of 0.75 g/kg (n = 9), 1.5 g/kg (n = 13) of ST in water, or water alone (WA, n = 13) at 5 mL/ kg body weight from day 6 to day 17. On day 18, retinal samples were collected. Retinal neovascularization (NV) was assessed by the NV score, and by the percentage of avascular area (% AVA), using a method previously reported. The number of severe retinal NV cases (NV > or = 9) was compared. The retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations were measured with an immunoassay kit, at 0, 12, 24, 72 and 144 hours after oxygenation. RESULTS: NV score and % AVA decreased in the ST treated group compared to the WA group. However, severe NV was seen in five cases of WA and in one case of the ST treated group. Thus severe NV was inhibited significantly by ST treatment (p = 0.0185). Retinal VEGF did not differ between groups at any time points. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that severe NV in OIR is inhibited by ST treatment.

21421041|t|Antifibrosis effects of total glucosides of Danggui-Buxue-Tang in a rat model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
21421041|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study examined the antifibrosis effects of DBTG (total glucosides of Danggui-Buxue-Tang) on bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury and fibrosis in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animals were randomly divided into six groups: (1) saline control group; (2) Bleomycin group in which rats were endotracheally instillated with bleomycin (5mg/kg); (3-5) Bleomycin and DBTG group, in which DBTG were given to rats daily (16.32 or 64mg/kg/day, i.g.) one day after bleomycin injection for 4 weeks until the end of the treatment; (6) Bleomycin and positive control group. Animals were sacrificed at 7, 14, and 28 days post bleomycin administration and lungs were removed. Lung specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson trichrome for histological evaluation of lung injury and fibrosis by light microscopy. Body weight and lung index from various groups were measured, as well as TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1 and type I collagen concentrations in lung homogenates. RESULTS: DBTG reduced bleomycin-induced weight loss, decreased the lung index and histological evidence supported the ability of DBTG to attenuate bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and consolidation. DBTG could partly dose-dependently decrease TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 activity, as well as it decrease type I collagen expression in lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study provide evidence that DBTG may serve as a novel target for potential therapeutic treatment of lung fibrosis.

She had been experiencing general fatigue, numbness in the hands, and weakness in the lower limbs and could not stand up without assistance. She presented with hypokalemia (potassium level, 1.7 mEq/L), increased urinary excretion of potassium (fractional excretion of K, 21.2%), abnormalities on an electrocardiogram (flat T waves in II, III, AVF, and V1-6), rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase level, 28,376 U/L), myopathy, metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation (O(2) flow rate, 2 L/min; pH, 7.473; pco(2), 61.0 mm Hg; po(2), 78.0 mm Hg; HCO(3), 44.1 mmol/L), hypertension (174/93 mm Hg), hyperglycemia (blood glucose level, 200-300 mg/dL), frequent urination, suppressed plasma renin activity (0.1 ng/mL/hour), decreased aldosterone levels (2.6 ng/dL), and increased urinary cortisol levels (600.6 microg/day; reference range, 26.0-187.0 microg/day). CONCLUSIONS: In this case, the observed reduction in the urinary cortisol levels, from 600.6 to 37.8 microg/day, led to a definitive diagnosis of pseudoaldosteronism instead of the apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome. Discontinuing shakuyaku-kanzo-to treatment and administering spironolactone and potassium proved effective in improving the patient's condition. Medical practitioners prescribing shakuyaku-kanzo-to should take into account the association between licorice, which is its main ingredient, and pseudoaldosteronism.

32237526|a|To investigate the antipyretic effect of active components of Mahuang Decoction in febrile rats, and explore its correlation with pharmacokinetics at different time points. The feverished rat models were induced by dry yeast, and intragastrically administered with the effective components of Mahuang Decoction with different orthogonal compatibility ratios. At different time points after administration, body temperature was measured; blood was taken from orbital vena plexus, and the contents of interleukin-6(IL-6), interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) in rat serum were determined with the kits. Combined with the pharmacokinetic data of the seven effective components in Mahuang Decoction, PK-PD(pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics) data fitting was conducted by using the analysis method of non-atrioventricular model, and then the pharmacodynamic parameters were calculated to determine the optimal binding model. The results showed that the effective components of Mahuang Decoction inhibited the release of heat-causing factors IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and reduced the increase of body temperature. There was a significant lag between drug effect and blood drug concentration, which was consistent with Sigmoid-E_(max) model. The model fitting value showed a good correlation with mea-sured data, which could be used to evaluate and predict the correlation between PK and PD in Mahuang Decoction, and further applied to the multiple-indicator and multiple-effect study of PK-PD in other compound traditional Chinese medicines.

10707545|a|A 66-year-old woman had been treated for 3 years by her local physician with Sho-saiko-to for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and liver cirrhosis. She was admitted to our hospital because of cough, fever, and infiltrative shadows on chest x-ray films. Sho-saiko-to-induced pneumonitis was diagnosed and steroid therapy started. Though a temporary improvement was observed, interstitial pneumonitis relapsed and the patient died of respiratory failure and liver dysfunction. Autopsy findings showed diffuse alveolar damage and honeycombing. Furthermore, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction techniques detected HCV-RNA in specimens of fibrotic lung tissue. For comparison, HCV-RNA was not histologically detected in lung tissue specimens from 4 control subjects who were positive for HCV antibodies but who did not have interstitial lung disease. It was speculated that the progression of interstitial pneumonia in the present case may have been caused by HCV in combination with Sho-saiko-to-induced lung injury.

25241226|t|Guibitang, a traditional herbal medicine, induces apoptotic death in A431 cells by regulating the activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases.
25241226|a|BACKGROUND: Guibi-tang (GBT), a traditional herbal formula, mainly has been shown to possess immune regulation, antioxidant and protective effect of the gastric mucosa. Constituent herbs of GBT are frequently used to treat various diseases; however, their pharmacological effects, especially on cancer cells, differ from those of GBT. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms behind effects of GBT remain unclear. In the present study, we explored the mechanism of chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic efficacy of GBT against human squamous cell carcinoma without cytotoxicity in normal cells and proved the efficacy of GBT through performing in vivo xenograft assay. METHODS: For analysis of the constituents of GBT, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-DAD system was performed. To detect the anticancer effect of GBT, cell viability assay, caspase activity assay, cell cycle analysis, DNA fragmentation analysis, and Western blot analysis were performed in A431 cells. In addition, the inhibitory effect of tumor growth by GBT was evaluated in athymic nude mice inoculated with A431 cells. RESULTS: GBT showed cytotoxic activity against three different squamous cell carcinoma, especially on A431 cells. GBT induced the apoptosis through activating the caspase-8 in A431 cells. Inhibition of A431 cell growth by GBT was caused by G1-phase arrest through regulating proteins associated with cell cycle progression, such as cyclin D1, p21, and p27. Furthermore, GBT regulated the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and activated p53, a tumor suppressor protein. In MAPKs inhibitor study, inhibitors respectively blocked GBT-induced cell viability, indicating that MAPKs signals play critical role in cell death caused by GBT. In vivo xenografts, daily oral administration of 600 mg/kg GBT efficiently suppressed the tumorigenic growth of A431 cells without side effects such as loss of body weight and change of toxicological parameters compared to vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: We first elucidate that GBT stimulates the apoptotic signaling pathway and suppresses the proliferation of A431 cells via regulating MAPKs signaling pathway. Furthermore, GBT significantly inhibits tumor growth of A431 cells without causing systemic toxicity. Based on our study, GBT could be useful in the management of skin cancer as chemoprevention and chemotherapy remedy.

30915149|t|Recognition and Optimization of Ingredients Treating Nitroglycerin-Induced Migraine Rats from Wuzhuyu Decoction.
30915149|a|Wuzhuyu decoction (WZYD) has been clinically used to treat migraine effectively since Eastern Han Dynasty of ancient China. However, its antimigrainic ingredients remain unclear. In present study, the antimigrainic ingredients of WZYD were explored and optimized in nitroglycerin-induced migraine rats through correlation analysis of decoction spectra-pharmacological effects and absorption spectra-pharmacological using entropy-weighted partial least squares regression method. The decoction spectra and absorption spectra were obtained through the determination of nine main ingredients in ten kinds of WZYDs and WZYDs' single-pass intestinal perfusion samples using high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector. The pharmacodynamics indexes related to migraine model rats were detected using high performance liquid chromatography method and kits after oral administration of WZYDs. Then, the key ingredients influencing indexes were achieved through the correlation analysis. And the optimization of key ingredients was acquired through uniform design experiment. The pharmacodynamic verification test was used to clarify the advantages of the optimized sample. The results showed that the final optimized sample, in which the concentrations of rutaecarpine, evodiamine, ginsendside Rb1, 6-gingerol, ginsendside Rg1, rutaevine, and limonin were 0.081, 0.565, 1.455, 0.159, 0.871, 0.178, and 0.009 mg.mL(-1), respectively, provided the best comprehensive effect than another optimized sample and the best uniform design sample. Therefore, a new reliable method for rapidly recognizing and optimizing the effective constituents of WZYD treating migraine was established.

8965402|a|We describe two cases of pneumonia caused by Sho-saiko-to. Patient 1 was a 61-year-old man with type-C liver cirrhosis. About 50 days after starting to take Sho-saiko-to, he complained of fever and diarrhea, and progressive dyspnea developed. Analysis of arterial blood obtained in the emergency room showed severe hypoxemia:, PaO2 26 Torr. A chest radiograph and a CT scan showed bilateral diffuse fine granular and ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lung fields. Despite repeated pulse therapy with methylprednisolone and aggressive medical treatment including mechanical ventilation, the patient remained in respiratory distress, which was later complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding. He died on the 45th hospital day. The bronchoalveolar lavage contained abnormally high fluid percents of lymphocytes and neutrophils. Postmortem examination of the lungs revealed alveolar septal thickening, marked hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes, and no hyaline membrane formation. Patient 2 was a 68-year-old man. Eighty days after he began taking Sho-saiko-to, he presented with a 4-day history of shortness of breath accompanied by fewer and progressive coughing. On arrival of the hospital, arterial blood gas analysis showed mild hypoxemia (PaO2, 61 Torr) and a chest radiograph revealed bilateral irregular infiltrates in the lower lung fields. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed an abnormally high percent of lymphocytes (especially CD8 + lymphocytes), and examination of a biopsy specimen revealed exudates of fibrin and neutrophils in the alveolar spaces and patechy intraluminal organization. The response to prednisolone was good and he was discharged on the 40th hospital day in stable condition. Drug lymphocyte stimulation tests of peripheral blood to Sho-saiko-to were positive in both patients. Patients 2 was though to have a typical case of Sho-saiko-to-induced pneumonia, patient 1 was thought to have fulminating variant of this disease.

34872278|t|Clinical effects of Lingguizhugan decoction in the treatment of hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
34872278|a|BACKGROUND: Lingguizhugan decoction is commonly used to treat metabolic syndrome; however, its curative effect on hypertension is still unclear. Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Lingguizhugan decoction combined with western medicine in the treatment of hypertension. METHODS: We searched 7 electronic databases for relevant studies and full-text articles involved in the evaluation of clinical effects difference between Lingguizhugan decoction combined with western medicine and western medicine alone. All included articles were quality assessed and data analysis was conducted with Review Manager (5.4). Sensitivity analysis was performed, and the results were visualized by means of forest and funnel plots. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD), together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In total, 7 studies eventually met our inclusion criteria. The results showed that Lingguizhugan decoction combined with western medicine had a better improvement in decrease systolic blood pressure (SBP) (MD =12.33 mmHg; 95% CI: 3.37 to 21.28; P=0.007) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (MD =7.42 mmHg; 95% CI: 1.89 to 12.95; P=0.009) than western medicine alone, it also had a higher effective ratio (RR =1.20; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.31; P<0.0001) and lower adverse reactions (RR =0.51; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.86; P=0.01). The results were robust and no obvious publication bias was observed in this study. DISCUSSION: Our research supported that Lingguizhugan decoction combined with western medicine can effectively reduce patients' blood pressure and improve their clinical symptoms. Because of the limitation in the quantity and quality of the included studies, further large sample and multi center follow-up controlled trials should be carried out to validate our conclusions.

33052137|t|Free Wanderer Powder regulates AMPA receptor homeostasis in chronic restraint stress-induced rat model of depression with liver-depression and spleen-deficiency syndrome.
33052137|a|Free Wanderer Powder (FWP) is a classic formula for depression with digestive dysfunctions, i.e., liver-depression and spleen-deficiency syndrome (LDSDS) in Chinese Medicine. But its protective mechanism has not been fully clarified. Here a chronic restraint stress (CRS) induced rat model showed depression with LDSDS in food intake, metabolism, and behaviour tests. Then 75 rats were randomly divided, and received CRS and different treatment with behaviour tests. Expressions of c-Fos and AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunits GluR1-3 in hippocampus CA1, CA3, DG and amygdala BLA were detected by immunohistochemistry, western blot and RT-PCR, respectively. In CRS rats, FWP alleviated depressive behaviour and c-Fos expression. FWP suppressed the increasement of GluR1 in CA1 and DG, p-GluR1 in CA1, and p-GluR2 and GluR3 in BLA. FWP also blocked the decrease of GluR1 and Glur2/3 in CA3, p-GluR1 in CA3, and p-GluR2 in CA1 and CA3. Furthermore, constituents of FWP and their potential targets were explored using UHPLC-MS and systematic bioinformatics analysis. There were 23 constituents identified in FWP, 9 of which regulated glutamatergic synapse. Together, these results suggest that FWP contains effective constituents and alleviates depression with LDSDS by regulating AMPA-type glutamate receptor homeostasis in amygdala and hippocampus.

26508134|a|BACKGROUND: Chinese medicine xiangshaliujunzi decoction (XSLJZD) plays a key role in treating functional dyspepsia (FD), a common clinical gastrointestinal disorder. However, the mechanism of this disease is unclear. Brain-gut axis regulates food intake behaviour, and this regulatory mechanism is mediated by neuropeptides. Brain-gut axis impairment and neuropeptide alteration may be the pathological mechanisms of FD, and brain-gut axis regulation may influence the action of medicine. METHODS: In our experiment, the effect of XSLJZD on FD was evaluated in terms of food intake, sucrose preference test and electromyogram. Changes in neuropeptides [ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)] were detected through immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: XSLJZD increased food intake and the percentage of sucrose preference (>75 %). However, the response to gastric detention decreased. Furthermore, XSLJZD increased ghrelin, CCK, VIP proteins and genes in the stomach. XSLJZD also increased ghrelin, CCK and VIP proteins in serum. By contrast, XSLJZD decreased the mRNA expression of these neuropeptides in the hypothalamus. CONCLUSIONS: XSLJZD alleviated the symptoms of FD by upregulating the production of ghrelin, CCK and VIP and by increasing the levels of these neuropeptides in circulation. This finding can help elucidate the mechanism of FD and can provide further insight into the pharmacokinetics of XSLJZD.
26508134|k|CONCLUSIONS: XSLJZD alleviated the symptoms of FD by upregulating the production of ghrelin, CCK and VIP and by increasing the levels of these neuropeptides in circulation.

24804857|t|Therapeutic effect of Zeng Ye decoction on primary Sjogren's syndrome via upregulation of aquaporin1 and aquaporin5 expression levels.
24804857|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the curative effect of Zeng Ye decoction on primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and further explore its underlying mechanism involving aquaporin (AQP)1 and AQP5. The pSS model was established based on the immune induction method, and the saliva flow, submandibular gland index, morphological structures of salivary glands, and AQP1 and AQP5 protein expression levels in the salivary glands were determined. The saliva flow and the submandibular gland index were significantly reduced in the model group (P<0.01, compared with those in the control group), and significantly increased following interferon (IFN), Zeng Ye decoction extraction (ZYE) and Zeng Ye decoction (ZY) treatment (P<0.01, compared with those of the model group). Submandibular gland atrophy, fibrous tissue hyperplasia and multiple focal lymphocytic infiltration were observed in the model group and were attenuated when subjected to IFN, ZYE and ZY treatment. The AQP1 and AQP5 expression levels increased following IFN, ZYE and ZY treatment (P<0.01, compared with those of the model group), particularly in the ZYE35 group. This result indicated that ZYE had a significant protective effect on pSS via upregulation of the expression levels of AQP1 and/or AQP5. However, the AQP1 expression levels increased and the AQP5 expression levels decreased in the model groups compared with those in the control group, which indicated different regulatory pathways of the salivary gland damage on the basis of AQP1 and AQP5. This study provided a significant reference for the prevention and treatment of pSS.

30703109|t|Kami-shoyo-san improves ASD-like behaviors caused by decreasing allopregnanolone biosynthesis in an SKF mouse model of autism.
30703109|a|Dysfunctions in the GABAergic system are associated with the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the mechanisms by which GABAergic system dysfunctions induce the pathophysiology of ASD remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that a selective type I 5alpha-reductase inhibitor SKF105111 (SKF) induced ASD-like behaviors, such as impaired sociability-related performance and repetitive grooming behaviors, in male mice. Moreover, the effects of SKF were caused by a decrease in the endogenous levels of allopregnanolone (ALLO), a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. In this study, we used SKF-treated male mice as a putative animal model of ASD and examined the effects of Kami-shoyo-san (KSS) as an experimental therapeutic strategy for ASD. KSS is a traditional Kampo formula consisting of 10 different crude drugs and has been used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms. KSS dose-dependently attenuated sociability deficits and suppressed an increase in grooming behaviors in SKF-treated mice without affecting ALLO content in the prefrontal cortex. The systemic administration of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 reversed the ameliorative effects of KSS. On the other hand, the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride and GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline only attenuated the ameliorative effect of KSS on repetitive self-grooming behaviors. The present results indicate that KSS improves SKF-induced ASD-like behaviors by facilitating dopamine receptor-mediated mechanisms and partly by neurosteroid-independent GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission. Therefore, KSS is a potential candidate for the treatment of ASD.

34293457|t|Si-Wu-Tang facilitates ovarian function through improving ovarian microenvironment and angiogenesis in a mouse model of premature ovarian failure.
34293457|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a severe illness, characterized by premature menopause with a markedly decrease in ovarian function, which leads to infertility. Si-Wu-Tang (SWT), also called "the first prescription of gynecology" by medical experts in China, is widely used as the basic formula in regulating the menstrual cycle and treating infertility. However, the potential effect and underlying mechanisms of action of SWT on the treatment of POF have not yet been elucidated. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect and underlying molecular mechanism of action of SWT on the treatment of POF in C57BL/6 mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main compounds of SWT were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). POF model groups were established by a single intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (Cy, 100 mg/kg). SWT or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were administered via oral gavage for 28 consecutive days. Ovarian function and pathological changes were evaluated by hormone levels, follicular development, and changes in angiogenesis. Furthermore, statistical analyses of fertility were also performed. RESULTS: Treatment with SWT significantly improved estrogen levels, the number of follicles, antioxidant defense, and microvascular formation in POF mice. Moreover, SWT significantly activated the Nrf2/HO-1 and STAT3/HIF-1alpha/VEGF signaling pathways to promote angiogenesis, resulting in a better fertility outcome when compared to the model group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that SWT protected ovarian function of Cy-induced POF mice by improving the antioxidant ability and promoting ovarian angiogenesis, thereby providing scientific evidence for the treatment of POF using SWT.

33607201|t|Efficacy of Shenling Baizhu San on stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
33607201|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shenling Baizhu San (SBS) as a classic Chinese medicine prescription, has been extensively used in gastrointestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and chronic diarrhea. In recent years, SBS has shown a beneficial effect on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. However, clinical trials had shown conflicting results of SBS on improving pulmonary function and other related indicators of patients with stable COPD. The efficacy of SBS on stable COPD patients has not been fully assessed. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine whether the SBS used in the treatment of gastrointestinal disease was effective to treat COPD, we assessed the clinical evidence and efficacy of SBS supplemental treatment on stable COPD patients by a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine electronic databases were searched to include clinical trials (published until August 31, 2020) with SBS as a supplementation treatment on stable COPD. Mean difference (MD) was used to evaluate continuous variables, odds ratio (OR) was calculated to evaluate dichotomous. The Egger's test was applied for publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 770 COPD participants from 11 trials that met the inclusion criteria were included. The meta-analysis showed that modified SBS could improve the exercise endurance, life quality scores of stable COPD patients, and also showed the potential benefits to pulmonary function of COPD patients than original SBS. CONCLUSION: The methodological quality of included trials may limit the conclusions that indicate that modified SBS may have a promising treatment for improving FEV1/FVC and MVV, increasing exercise endurance and life quality scores on stable COPD patients.

28871699|a|To evaluate the effect of different fractions of Taohong Siwu decoction on ADP-induced platelet aggregation and thrombin activity, and to exploit the bioactive constituents, ADP-induced platelet aggregation rate in rabbits was determined by using the method of turbidity method. A bioassay called thrombin time was developed for determining anti-thrombin activities. UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS method was used to qualitatively analyze the chemical constituents of different parts. Alcohol precipitation deposition fraction, alcohol precipitation supernatant fraction and 20% to 30% alcohol elution fraction could significantly inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Alcohol precipitation supernatant fraction, water insoluble fraction and 40% to 70% alcohol elution fraction could significantly inhibit thrombin activity. The main components of alcohol precipitation deposition fraction, alcohol precipitation supernatant fraction and 20% to 40% alcohol elution fraction were analyzed and identified as aromatic acids, glycosides and phthalides. The bioactive constituents of Taohong Siwu decoction for inhibiting ADP-induced platelet aggregation and thrombin activity include aromatic acids, glycosides and phthalides. This experiment provides scientific basis to further explore the bioactive constituents and mechanism of Taohong Siwu decoction in treating blood stasis syndrome.

23019951|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of Sini Decoction (SD) on the expressions of Samd2 and Smad7 isoproterenol (Iso) induced myocardial fibrosis rats. METHODS: Totally 19 Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, i.e., the control group, the model group, and the SD group. Iso was injected to rats in the model group and the SD group, while normal saline was injected to rats in the control group. SD was given to rats in the SD group by gastrogavage, while normal saline was administered to rats in the control group and the model group by gastrogavage. Four weeks later Masson staining and electron microscopic analysis were performed in each group. The protein and mRNA expressions of Smad2 and Smad7 were detected using immunohistochemical assay and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Masson staining showed the IOD value of the myocardial collagen fiber was 9 303 in the model group, 2 459 in the SD group, and 4 224 in the control group, indicating the myocardial fibrosis was more obvious in the model group than in the SD group and the control group. The IOD value of Smad2 protein was 20 275 and the mRNA IOD of Smad2 protein was 0. 919 in the model group, while they were respectively 9 949 and 0. 561 in the SD group, indicating the protein and mRNA expressions of Smad2 were obviously higher in the model group than in the SD group (P < 0.05). The IOD value of Smad7 protein was 25 667 and the mRNA IOD of Smad7 protein was 0.222 in the model group, while they were respectively 93 147 and 0. 412 in the SD group, indicating the protein and mRNA expressions of Smad7 was obviously lower in the model group than in the SD group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SD could effectively inhibit Iso induced myocardial fibrosis, and its mechanism may be associated with down-regulating the expression of Smad2 and up-regulating the expression of Smad7.

28694833|t|Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang Extract Ameliorates Depression-Like Behaviors through BDNF-TrkB-CREB Pathway in Rats with Chronic Unpredictable Stress.
28694833|a|Neuroinflammation is considered as one of the common pathogeneses of depression. Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang (HJDT) is a traditional Chinese herbal formula. The present study investigates the antidepressant-like effect of HJDT and its possible mechanism in rats. Rats were given HJDT (2, 4, and 8 g/kg, intragastrically), paroxetine (1.8 mg/kg, intragastrically), or an equivalent volume of saline for 42 days. The depression-related behaviors, including sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT), novel objective recognition task (NORT), and forced swimming test (FST), were detected. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) contents, microglial activation, proinflammatory cytokines, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin receptor kinases B (TrkB), and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) expression were investigated. The results indicated HJDT (2 and 4 g/kg) dramatically ameliorated the depression-like behaviors. Also HJDT decreased the number of microglia and the proinflammatory cytokines in hippocampus. Western-blotting analysis displayed HJDT upregulated BDNF, TrkB, and pCREB/CREB expression in hippocampus. Particularly, pCREB DNA activity enhanced with HJDT treatment in hippocampus. But there was no difference in the 5-HT and DA contents with HJDT treatment. In conclusion, it was supposed that HJDT might be a potential Chinese medicine decoction for treating or alleviating complex symptoms of depression through BDNF-TrkB-CREB pathway.

29132134|t|Xia-Yu-Xue Decoction Inhibits Intestinal Epithelial Cell Apoptosis in CCl4-Induced Liver Fibrosis.
29132134|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intestine-derived endotoxin is thought to play a role in the development of liver fibrosis. However, the pathological change in the intestine during liver fibrosis is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of Xia-yu-xue decoction (XYXD) on intestinal inflammation, apoptosis, and tight junction integrity in the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis. METHODS: Murine liver fibrosis was developed by CCI4 treatment three times per week over a 6-week period. The CCl4-treated mice were divided into two groups: the CCl4-water group (n=8, CCl4) and the CCl4-XYXD group (n=8, CCl4+XYXD). The CCl4+XYXD mice were treated with XYXD from the beginning of the first week. The expression of inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic molecules were examined using immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, and western blot. The intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis was examined by TUNEL staining. The tight junction-related molecules, such as ZO-1, claudin, and occludin in the gut were measured by real-time PCR. RESULTS: In CCl4-treated mice damage of the intestinal epithelia and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lamina propria and muscular layer were observed. Proinflammatory markers MCP-1, TNF-alpha, CXCL11, IL-6, and CD68 were significantly increased in the intestinal epithelia in CCI4-treated mice. The expression of pro-apoptotic molecules including Fas and Bax was increased in the intestinal epithelia in CCI4-treated mice compared with that in control. The number of TUNEL-positive intestinal epithelial cells was also markedly increased in CCl4-treated mice. The expression of the tight junction proteins including ZO-1, claudin, and occludin was significantly decreased in CCI4-treated mice compared with that in control mice. Notably, XYXD treatment ameliorated increased inflammatory markers and apoptosis-related molecules and decreased tight-junction proteins in CCl4-treated mice. CONCLUSION: CCl4-treatment increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and pro-apoptotic molecules and disrupted tight junction integrity in the intestine. XYXD treatment ameliorated intestinal inflammation, cell death, and tight junction disintegrity induced by CCl4 treatment, suggesting that XYXD inhibits CCl4-mediated liver fibrosis at least in part by ameliorating the intestinal epithelial damage.

32849904|t|Si-Wu-Tang Alleviates Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease via Blocking TLR4-JNK and Caspase-8-GSDMD Signaling Pathways.
32849904|a|BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has high global prevalence; however, the treatments of NAFLD are limited due to lack of approved drugs. METHODS: Mice were randomly assigned into three groups: Control group, NAFLD group, NAFLD plus Si-Wu-Tang group. A NAFLD mice model was established by feeding with a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for four weeks. Si-Wu-Tang was given orally by gastric gavage at the beginning of 3rd week, and it lasted for two weeks. The treatment effects of Si-Wu-Tang were confirmed by examining the change of body weight, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, Oil Red O staining, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the liver samples and accompanied by steatosis grade scores. The expression and activation of the possible signaling proteins involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD were determined by western blotting. RESULTS: Mice fed with four weeks of MCD diet displayed elevated serum levels of ALT and AST, while there was decreased body weight. The hepatic Oil Red O staining and H&E staining showed severe liver steatosis with high steatosis grade scores. All these can be improved by treating with Si-Wu-Tang for two weeks. Mechanistically, the increased hepatic TLR4 expression and its downstream JNK phosphorylation induced by MCD diet were suppressed by Si-Wu-Tang. Moreover, the upregulations of Caspase-8, gasdermin D (GSDMD), and cleaved-GSDMD in liver mediated by MCD diet were all inhibited by Si-Wu-Tang. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with Si-Wu-Tang improves MCD diet-induced NAFLD in part via blocking TLR4-JNK and Caspase-8-GSDMD signaling pathways, suggesting that Si-Wu-Tang has potential for clinical application in treating NAFLD.

21155246|t|[Effects of er-long-zuo-ci-wan on the spontaneous activities of auditory central nucleus in rat model of tinnitus induced by salicylate acid].
21155246|a|AIM: Observe the effects of er-long-zuo-ci-wan (EIZCW, a compound of Chinese Traditional Medicine) on the spontaneous discharge of external cortex of inferior colliculus (ICx) and secondary auditory cortex (AII) of chronic tinnitus model rats induced by salicylate acid, to explore the neural mechanisms underlying ELZCW preventing tinnitus. METHODS: 30 adult SD rats were involved and divided into three groups, normal control group, chronic tinnitus model group and ELZCW prevention group. Extracellular recording techniques and stereotaxic method were used. The spontaneous spikes were recorded and analyzed from ICx and all in different group rats. The average rate of spontaneous discharge and the interspike interval histogram of spontaneous activities were used as indexes. RESULTS: (1) Compared with normal control group, the average rate of spontaneous discharge recorded from the ICx in the chronic tinnitus model group increased significantly (4.57 +/- 0.54 Hz vs. 3.14 +/- 0.40 Hz, P < 0.05). Furthermore analysis showed that the discharge rate of short spike interval from the ICx in the chronic tinnitus model group increased than that of the normal group (0-40 ms: 58% vs. 40%; 0-4 ms: 9% vs. 5%). And there was an increasing tendency of the average rate of spontaneous discharge recorded from the AII in the chronic tinnitus model group compared with that in the normal group. (2) Compared with the chronic tinnitus model group, the average rate of spontaneous discharge recorded from the ICx and AII in the ELZCW prevention group significantly decreased than that in the chronic tinnitus model group (ICx: 2.41 +/- 0.21 Hz vs. 4.57 +/- 0.54 Hz, P < 0.01. AII: 2.24 +/- 0.24 Hz vs. 4.57 +/- 0.54 Hz , P < 0.01). And the discharge rate of short spike interval from the ICx and AII in the chronic tinnitus model group decreased than that in the normal control group (ICx: 0-40 ms 50% vs. 58%, 0-4 ms 4% vs. 9%. All: 0-22 ms: 24% vs. 31%, 0-8 ms 19% vs. 16%). CONCLUSION: If the increasing of the spontaneous activities of ICx and AII in chronic tinnitus rats means tinnitus, the use of ELZCW could decrease this kind of changes.

22368862|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate therapeutic effect of Sishen Wan on experimental colitis, and explore its mechanism by expression of Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA, Fas/FasL in colonic tissue. METHOD: Experimental colitis was induced by rectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in ethanol. The model animals were divided into four groups: the induced colitis but untreated group, the induced colitis groups treated with the high, middle, low dose of Sishen Wan, and the induced colitis group treated with salicylazosulfapyridine (SASP). After 10 day administration, the body weight, colonic wet weight, colonic weight index, colonic damage score and pathological change were evaluated, and the level of Fas and FasL by flow cytometry, Bax mRNA and Bcl-2 mRNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCT). RESULT: Compared with the model group, the colonic wet weight and colonic weight index were remarkably decreased in the middle dose of Sishen Wan group (P < 0.05). The colonic injury scores were significantly reduced after rats were treated with the three doses of Sishen Wan (P < 0.05). Representative restored features were observed including fewer inflammatory cellular infiltration and follicular hyperplasia, superficial and little ulcer with fibroplasia in colonic mucosa from the treated groups. The expression of Fas in the colonic mucosa was obviously down-regulated (P < 0.05) and the ratio of Bcl-2 mRNA/Bax mRNA was significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05) in the groups treated with the three doses of Sishen Wan. CONCLUSION: Sishen Wan might postpone colonic epithelium apoptosis or improve inflammatory cell apoptosis by regulating the expression of Fas/ FasL and Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA in colonic tissue, which is possible potential path to effectively treat experimental colitis by enema.

30209468|t|Correlation of drug-induced and drug-related ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry serum metabolomic profiles yields discovery of effective constituents of Sini decoction against myocardial ischemia in rats.
30209468|a|Screening active constituents of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) is vital for lead compound discovery. Sini decoction (SND) is a well-known TCM formula for relieving myocardial ischemia (MI) in clinic. Due to complex nature, the effective compounds of SND are still unknown. In this study, a novel "system to system" strategy based on the correlation of drug-related and drug-induced ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOFMS) serum metabolomic profiles was developed to discover bioactive compounds of SND against isoproterenol-induced MI. Thirteen SND-induced metabolites and 19 SND-related metabolites were identified by UHPLC-Q-TOFMS coupled with S-plot and SUS-plot of orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models, respectively. Canonical correlation analysis between the SND-induced and SND-related metabolites revealed that 12 compounds had strongly correlated relationship with the protective effect of SND on MI, and these compounds include isotalatizidine, songorine, fuziline, neoline, talatizamine, 14-acetyltalatizamine, liquiritigenin, benzoylmesaconitine, isoliquiritin, benzoylaconitne, benzoylhypaconitine and 6-gingerol. Combination functional enrichment analysis and network topology analysis revealed that the targeted metabolic pathways of these correlated compounds were involved in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosyntheses, tryptophan metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism. The results demonstrated that the "system to system" strategy may be a high-throughput method to discover potentially effective compounds from TCMs.

34607274|t|Systematic analysis of the mechanism of Xiaochaihu decoction in hepatitis B treatment via network pharmacology and molecular docking.
34607274|a|Hepatitis B (HB) is a globally prevalent infectious disease caused by the HB virus. Xiaochaihu decoction (XCHD) is a classic herbal formula with a long history of clinical application in treating HB. Although the anti-HB activity of XCHD has been reported, systematic research on the exact mechanism of action is lacking. Here, a network pharmacology-based approach was used to predict the active components, important targets, and potential mechanism of XCHD in HB treatment. Investigation included drug-likeness evaluation; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) screening; protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and cluster analysis; Gene Ontology (GO) analysis; and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation. Molecular docking was adopted to investigate the interaction between important target proteins and active components. Eighty-seven active components of XCHD and 155 anti-HB targets were selected for further analysis. The GO enrichment and similarity analysis results indicated that XCHD might perform similar or the same GO functions. Glycyrrhizae Radix (GR), one of the seven XCHD herbs, likely exerts some unique GO functions such as the regulation of interleukin-12 production, positive regulation of interleukin-1 beta secretion, and regulation of the I-kappaB/NF-kappaB complex. The PPI network and KEGG pathway analysis results showed that XCHD affects HB mainly through modulating pathways related to viral infection, immunity, cancer, signal transduction, and metabolism. Additionally, molecular docking verified that the active compounds (quercetin, chrysin, and capsaicin) could bind with the key targets. This work systematically explored the anti-HB mechanism of XCHD and provides a novel perspective for future pharmacological research.

33101925|t|Effectiveness a herbal medicine (Sipjeondaebo-tang) on adults with chronic fatigue syndrome: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
33101925|a|BACKGROUND: Sipjeondaebo-tang (SJDBT, Shi-quan-da-bu-tang in Chinese) is a widely prescribed herbal medicine in traditional Korean medicine. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SJDBT for treating chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). METHODS: Ninety-six eligible participants were randomly allocated to either the SJDBT or placebo groups in a 1:1 ratio. Nine grams of SJDBT or placebo granules were administered to the patients for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the response rate, defined as the proportion of participants with a score of 76 or higher in the Checklist Individual Strength assessment. Other measurements for fatigue severity, quality of life, and qi/blood/yin/yang deficiency were included. Safety was assessed throughout the trial. RESULTS: At week 8, the response rate did not significantly differ between the groups (SJDBT: 35.4%; placebo: 54.2%; P= 0.101, effect size [95% confidence interval] = 0.021 [-0.177, 0.218]). However, the scores of the visual analogue scale (P= 0.001, -0.327 [-0.506, -0.128]), Fatigue Severity Scale (P= 0.020, 0.480 [0.066, 0.889]), and Chalder fatigue scale (P= 0.004, -0.292 [-0.479, -0.101]) for the SJDBT group showed significant improvements in fatigue severity at the endpoint. Quality of life was not significantly different. Furthermore, SJDBT significantly ameliorated the severity of qi deficiency compared to that in the placebo group. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: This trial failed to show a significant improvement in fatigue severity, as assessed by the CIS-deprived response rate. It merely showed that SJDBT could alleviate the severity of fatigue and qi deficiency in patients with CFS. However, the further study is needed to confirm the details.

28854971|a|BACKGROUND: Recent reports have demonstrated that impaired barrier function and local microinflammation in the duodenal mucosa contribute to the pathogeneses of functional dyspepsia (FD). Thus, restoring normal barrier integrity becomes a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of FD. Sini-San (SNS) is a traditional Chinese prescription that exhibits therapeutic effects in FD, but the underlying mechanisms remain not well understood. METHODS: FD rats were established by tail clamping method and the therapeutic effect of SNS was evaluated by measuring the visceral sensitivity and gastric compliance. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) that reveals epithelial barrier integrity was measured by Ussing chamber. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, occludin and claudin-1, in the duodenum was determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence. The amount of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma (INF-gamma) in duodenal mucosa was detected by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA level of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) was measured by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: SNS could improve gastric compliance and attenuate visceral hypersensitivity (VH) in FD rats. TEER was decreased in FD rats, but treatment with SNS restored normal level of TEER and the expression of occludin and claudin-1 in FD rats. In addition, SNS administration ameliorated FD-associated increase in the production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and the expression of TRPV1. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of SNS on FD is at least partially through improvement of TJ integrity and attenuation of FD-associated low-grade inflammation in the duodenum. Our findings highlight the molecular basis of SNS-based treatment of FD in human patients.

21905282|t|SuHeXiang Wan essential oil alleviates amyloid beta induced memory impairment through inhibition of tau protein phosphorylation in mice.
21905282|a|SuHeXiang Wan (SHXW), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used orally for the treatment of seizures, infantile convulsions and stroke. Previously, we reported the effects of a modified SHXW essential oil in terms of sedative effect, anticonvulsant activity and antioxidative activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of SHXW essential oil in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). SHXW essential oil was extracted from nine herbs. The mouse AD model was induced by a single injection of amyloid beta protein (Abeta(1-42)) into the hippocampus. The animals were divided into four groups, the negative control group injected with Abeta(42-1), the Abeta group injected with Abeta(1-42), the SHXW group inhaled SHXW essential oil and received Abeta(1-42) injection, and the positive control group administered with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 10 mg/kg) and with subsequent Abeta(1-42) injection. Mice were analyzed by behavioral tests and immunological examination in the hippocampus. An additional in vitro investigation was performed to examine whether SHXW essential oil inhibits Abeta(1-42) induced neurotoxicity in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y cells. Pre-inhalation of SHXW essential oil improved the Abeta(1-42) induced memory impairment and suppressed Abeta(1-42) induced JNK, p38 and Tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus. SHXW essential oil suppressed Abeta-induced apoptosis and ROS production via an up-regulation of HO-1 and Nrf2 expression in SH-SY5Y cells. The present study suggests that SHXW essential oil may have potential as a therapeutic inhalation drug for the prevention and treatment of AD.

32300604|t|Effect of Huangqin Tang on Colonic Gene Expression in Rats with Ulcerative Colitis.
32300604|a|In this study, we explored the pharmacological mechanisms of Huangqin Tang (HQT; a traditional Chinese medicine formula) in ulcerative colitis (UC) and provided evidence for potential roles HQT plays by gene expression profiling. The UC rat model was made via a compound method (trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid plus ethanol). After a ten-day treatment, microarray analysis was performed from the colon segment of the rats. Biological functions and specific signaling pathways were enriched based on differentially expressed genes (DEG), and corresponding gene networks were constructed via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Through the network, we screened the potential "candidate targets," such as ITGB1, FN1, CASP3, and ITGA5 and FABP1, ABCB1, FABP2, and SLC51B. These potential candidate targets were functionally related to immune responses, inflammation, and metabolism. Moreover, HQT significantly decreased serum levels of proinflammatory factors nitrogen monoxide (NO), proinflammatory cytokines interleukin- (IL-) 17, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The degree of HE staining of colonic tissue was severe in the model group but reduced significantly in the HQT group. HQT exhibited protective effects against colon damage by inhibiting the inflammatory response.

15330495|t|Protective effect of keishi-bukuryo-gan and its constituent medicinal plants against nitric oxide donor-induced neuronal death in cultured cerebellar granule cells.
15330495|a|Keishi-bukuryo-gan (Gui-Zhi-Fu-Ling-Wan) (KBG) is a traditional Chinese/Japanese medical (Kampo) formulation that has been administered to patients with "Oketsu" (blood stagnation) syndrome. In the process of neuronal cell death induced by brain ischemia, excessive generation of nitric oxide (NO) free radicals is implicated in the neurotoxicity. In the present study, we examined the protective effects of KBG and its constituent medicinal plants against NO donors, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and 2,2'-(hydroxynitrosohydrazino)bis-ethanamine (NOC18)-induced neuronal death in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). MTT assay showed cell viability to be significantly increased by the addition of KBG extract (KBGE) (100 microg/ml), Cinnamomi Cortex extract (CCE) (3, 10 and 30 microg/ml), Paeoniae Radix extract (PRE) (100 microg/ml) and Moutan Cortex extract (MCE) (10 and 30 microg/ml) compared with exposure to SNP (30 microM, 24 h) only. Also, cell viability was significantly increased by the addition of KBGE (100 and 300 microg/ml), CCE (30 and 100 microg/ml), PRE (100 and 300 microg/ml) and MCE (30 and 100 microg/ml) compared with exposure to NOC 18 (100 microM, 48 h) only. Persicae Semen extract and Hoelen extract did not protect against NO donor-induced neuronal death. These results suggest that KBG has protective effect against NO-mediated neuronal death in cultured CGCs and that it is derived from Cinnamomi Cortex, Paeoniae Radix and Moutan Cortex.

22719787|t|A Pilot Study for the Neuroprotective Effect of Gongjin-dan on Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion-Induced Ischemic Rat Brain.
22719787|a|In this study, we investigated whether gongjin-dan improves functional recovery and has neuroprotective effects on reducing the infarct volume after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Infarct volume was measured using TTC staining and glucose utilization by F-18 FDG PET. Functional improvement was evaluated with the Rota-rod, treadmill, Garcia score test, and adhesive removal test. At 14 days after MCAo, neuronal cell survival, astrocytes expansion, and apoptosis were assessed by immunohistofluorescence staining in the peri-infarct region. Also, the expression of neurotrophic factors and inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, BDNF, Cox-2, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1alpha was measured in ischemic hemisphere regions. The gongjin-dan-treated group showed both reduced infarct volume and increased glucose utilization. Behavior tests demonstrated a significant improvement compared to the control. Also in the gongjin-dan treated group, NeuN-positive cells were increased and number of astrocytes, microglia, and apoptotic cells was significantly decreased compared with the control group in the ischemic peri-infarct area. Furthermore, the expression of VEGF and BDNF was increased and level of Cox-2, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1alpha was decreased. These results suggest that gongjin-dan may improve functional outcome through the rapid restoration of metabolism and can be considered as a potential neuroprotective agent.

10612567|t|Effect of the Chinese herbal medicine, Bakumondo-to, on airway hyperresponsiveness induced by ozone exposure in guinea-pigs.
10612567|a|OBJECTIVE: Bakumondo-to (Maimendong tang) is a Chinese herbal medicine that has been used as an anti-tussive agent. However, the effects of Bakumondo-to on airway hyperresponsiveness are unknown. We examine whether Bakumondo-to can inhibit airway hyperresponsiveness induced by ozone. METHODOLOGY: Measurements of airway responsiveness and plasma extravasation and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed before and after ozone exposure (3 p.p.m., 2 h). Guinea-pigs were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and mechanically ventilated. Airway responsiveness was determined by an inhalation of doubling concentration of histamine, and the concentration of histamine required to produce a 200% increase in R(L) (PC200) was calculated by log-linear interpolation. Plasma extravasation was evaluated by measuring the extravasation of Evans blue dye in the airway. RESULTS: Ozone produced significant airway hyperresponsiveness and plasma extravasation, with an influx of neutrophils in BAL fluid. Bakumondo-to (400 mg/kg p.o.) significantly inhibited airway hyperresponsiveness, but had no effect on neutrophil influx or plasma extravasation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that Bakumondo-to can attenuate airway hyperresponsiveness induced by ozone without affecting airway inflammation, which suggests that Bakumondo-to may act on the subsequent mechanisms after the induction of inflammation, such as mediator release.

27347409|t|Effects of the Sijunzi decoction on the immunological function in rats with dextran sulfate-induced ulcerative colitis.
27347409|a|The present study investigated the effects of the Sijunzi decoction (SJZD) at various dosages on the immunological function of rats with 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; molecular weight 5,000)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC). A total of 40 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: Normal, model, low-dose SJZD, moderate-dose SJZD and high-dose SJZD groups. The 3% DSS was intragastrically administered for 7 consecutive days in order to induce the UC model. The normal group consumed distilled water. Subsequently, SJZD (5.0, 10.0 and 30.0 g/kg) was intragastrically administered, and scores of the disease activity index (DAI) were calculated. After 2 weeks, all the rats were sacrificed. Scores of the colon mucosa damage index (CMDI) were evaluated; and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) were measured in intestinal tissue by ELISA assays. The model group rats had ulcers, hyperemia and interstitial edema and infiltrated inflammatory cells. SJZD attenuated the severity of the gross lesions and reduced the histopathological injuries. Compared with the normal group, DAI and CMDI were significantly increased (P<0.01), and levels of determined sIgA in the intestinal mucosa and IL-2 in the intestinal tissue were significantly decreased (P<0.05) in the model group. Compared with the model group, moderate and high doses of SJZD showed a restoration effect on all the aforementioned indexes, and the high dose was the most effective. In conclusion, SJZD can ameliorate inflammation in DSS-induced UC rats. The mechanism is most likely due to enhancing intestinal local immunity.

26264147|t|Inhibitory effect of Samul-tang on retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy.
26264147|a|BACKGROUND: Retinal neovascularization is a common cause of vision loss in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity and age-related macular degeneration. Samul-tang (SMT) is a widely used traditional herbal medicine in East Asia and is also known as Shimotsu-to in Japanese and Si-Wu decoction in Chinese. This study was designed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of SMT on retinal pathogenic angiogenesis in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). METHOD: The mice were exposed to a 75% concentration of oxygen for five days, starting on postnatal day 7 (P7-P12). The mice were then exposed to room air and were intraperitoneally injected with SMT (10 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg) once per day for five days (P12-P16). On P17, we measured retinal neovascularization and evaluated both the expression of angiogenesis-related proteins and changes in the gene expression level in the mRNA. RESULTS: SMT reduced the area of the central retina and reduced retinal neovascularization in OIR mice. The protein array revealed that SMT reduced the level of SDF-1 protein expression. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the HIF-1alpha, SDF-1, CXCR4 and VEGF mRNA levels in the retinas of OIR mice were elevated compared with those of normal control mice. However, SMT decreased the levels of HIF-1alpha, SDF-1, CXCR4 and VEGF mRNA in OIR mice. CONCLUSION: We are the first to elucidate that SMT inhibits the retinal pathogenic angiogenesis induced by ischemic retinopathy in OIR mice. SMT significantly inhibited retinal neovascularization by downregulating HIF-1alpha, SDF-1, CXCR4 and VEGF. Based on the results of our study, SMT could be a useful herbal medicine for treating ischemic retinopathy.

26358493|t|Interaction of dendritic cells and T lymphocytes for the therapeutic effect of Dangguiliuhuang decoction to autoimmune diabetes.
26358493|a|In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Dangguiliuhuang decoction (DGLHD) is an effective treatment of autoimmune diabetes. Here, we studied potential anti-diabetic mechanisms of DGLHD in a non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. In vitro, DGLHD and individual active ingredients enhanced glucose uptake in HepG2 cells, inhibited T lymphocyte proliferation, and suppressed dendritic cells (DCs) function. In vivo, DGLHD significantly inhibited insulitis, delayed the onset and development of diabetes, promoted insulin secretion and sensitivity, and balanced partially normalized Th1 and Th2 cytokines in NOD mice. In addition, DGLHD increased alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT-1), Bcl-2, and CyclinD1, and decreased Bax levels in pancreas, spleen, thymus, DCs, and a NIT-1 cell line, all consistent with protecting and repairing islet beta cell. More detailed studies indicated that DGLHD regulated the maturation and function of DCs, decreased the percentage of merocytic dendritic cells (mcDCs) subset, and increased programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in DCs. DGLHD also impeded T lymphocyte proliferation and promoted regulatory T cells (T(regs)) differentiation in vivo. A JAK2-STAT3-dependent pathway was involved in the suppression by DGLHD of interactions between DCs and T lymphocyte. The experiments implicated five active ingredients in specific anti-diabetic actions of DGLHD. The results demonstrated the reasonable composition of the formula.

25652798|t|The effect of Chinese herbal medicine Jian Ling Decoction for the treatment of essential hypertension: a systematic review.
25652798|a|OBJECTIVES: Jian Ling Decoction (JLD) is often prescribed to improve hypertension-related symptoms in China. However, this treatment has not been systematically reviewed for its efficacy against essential hypertension (EH). This review aims to assess the current clinical evidence of JLD in the treatment of EH. DESIGN: Seven electronic databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) and the Wanfang Database, were searched up to March 2014. Randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing JLD or combined with antihypertensive drugs versus antihypertensive drugs were included. We assessed the methodological quality, extracted the valid data and conducted the meta-analysis according to criteria from the Cochrane group. The primary outcome was categorical or continuous blood pressure (BP), and the secondary outcome was quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: Ten trials (655 patients) with unclear-to-high risk of bias were identified. Meta-analysis showed that JLD used alone showed no BP reduction effect; however, improvement on QOL was found in the JLD group compared to antihypertensive drugs. A significant reduction in systolic and diastolic BP was observed for JLD plus antihypertensive drugs when compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. No serious adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to insufficient clinical data, it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion regarding the effectiveness and safety of JLD for EH, and better trials are needed.

1434235|a|We report a case of pneumonitis and hepatic injury caused by Sho-saiko-to. A 56-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of hepatic disorder. The levels of serum transaminases returned to normal within two months without specific treatment and he was discharged. Four weeks later, he was readmitted because of severe pneumonitis and mild hepatic disorder. Under the suspicion of drug-induced pneumonitis, all medications were discontinued and high-dose glucocorticoid including "pulse therapy" was given. Consequently, pneumonitis and hepatic function markedly improved. Careful history taking revealed the ingestion of Sho-saiko-to before both admissions. Lymphocyte stimulation test against Sho-saiko-to was positive. Challenge test using Sho-saiko-to resulted in decrease of PaO2 and elevation of serum transaminases. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of pneumonitis and hepatic injury induced by Sho-saiko-to was established.

29136778|t|Zuogui Pill improves the dexamethasone-induced osteoporosis progression in zebrafish larvae.
29136778|a|The current study was to evaluate the protective effects of Chinese medicine prescription Zuogui Pill (ZGP) on osteoporosis (OP) in zebrafish larvae induced by dexamethasone. Alizarin Red staining, calcium and phosphorus determination were performed to evaluate the effect of ZGP on bone mineralization. Hydroxyproline (HP), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) were also measured by commercial kits. We found that ZGP had positive effects in increasing bone mineral content (BMC), strengthening bone biomechanical, promoting bone formation, inhibiting bone resorption, and mediating protein levels of TGF-beta1/Smads signaling pathway. The findings demonstrated that ZGP treatments inhibited the phosphorylation of TGF-beta and p-Smad 3 as well as the expressions of collagen I and collagen II by western blot. Taken together, we demonstrated that ZGP may prevent osteoporosis via reversing the imbalance of bone fomation/bone resorption and activating the TGF-beta-Smad signal.

32930262|t|Shenling Baizhu San improves functional dyspepsia in rats as revealed by (1)H-NMR based metabolomics.
32930262|a|Functional dyspepsia (FD), a common gastrointestinal disorder around the world, is driven by multiple factors, making prevention and treatment a major challenge. Shenling Baizhu San (SBS), a classical prescription of traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to be effective in gastrointestinal disorders. However, studies on SBS improving FD are few. Thus, our study aimed to evaluate the effect of SBS on FD and further to explore the mechanism underlying the interactions between FD and SBS by the metabolomics approach. A FD rat model was induced by multiple forms of mild stimulation, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis were used to profile the fecal and urinary metabolome in the FD rats during SBS intervention. Significant dyspeptic symptoms such as weight loss, poor appetite, reduced gastrointestinal motility and decreased absorptive capacity were observed in the FD rats, which were subsequently improved by SBS. Additionally, the levels of citrate, branched chain acids and pyruvate decreased, and the levels of choline, trimethylamine and taurine increased in the FD rats. Furthermore, the metabolic disorders were amended with SBS intervention mainly by modulating the metabolic pathways involved in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and gut microbiota and host co-metabolism. Overall, our study highlighted the effect of SBS on the disturbed metabolic pathways in the FD rats, providing new insight into the mechanism of SBS treatment for FD from the perspective of metabolomics.

34306252|t|The Mechanism of Xiaoyao San in the Treatment of Ovarian Cancer by Network Pharmacology and the Effect of Stigmasterol on the PI3K/Akt Pathway.
34306252|a|PURPOSE: This study was aimed at exploring the regulatory mechanism of Xiaoyao San (XYS) and its main compound, Stigmasterol, in the biological network and signaling pathway of ovarian cancer (OC) through network pharmacology-based analyses and experimental validation. METHODS: The active compounds and targets of XYS were studied by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). The GeneCards and OMIM databases were used to screen common targets of XYS in the treatment of OC. Combined with the STRING database and Cytoscape 3.6.0, the core compounds and targets of XYS were obtained. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of core target genes were carried out by using the Metascape and DAVID databases. Molecular docking has been achieved by using the AutoDock Vina program to discuss the interaction of the core targets and compounds of XYS in the treatment of OC. The effect of Stigmasterol on proliferation and migration were assessed by CCK8 and wound healing assay. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to analyze the protein and mRNA expressions of PI3K, Akt, and PTEN after treatment of Stigmasterol. RESULTS: A total of 113 common targets of XYS for the treatment of OC were obtained from 975 targets related to OC and 239 targets of XYS's effect. The main compounds of XYS include Quercetin, Naringenin, Isorhamnetin, and Stigmasterol, which mainly regulate the targets such as TP53, Akt1, and MYC and PI3K/Akt, p53, and cell cycle signal pathways. At the same time, molecular docking showed that Stigmasterol and Akt1 had good docking conformation. Stigmasterol inhibited OC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and reduced the protein and mRNA expressions of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Stigmasterol as the one of the main compounds of XYS suppresses OC cell activities through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

21423636|t|The Traditional Herbal Medicine, Dangkwisoo-San, Prevents Cerebral Ischemic Injury through Nitric Oxide-Dependent Mechanisms.
21423636|a|Dangkwisoo-San (DS) is an herbal extract that is widely used in traditional Korean medicine to treat traumatic ecchymosis and pain by promoting blood circulation and relieving blood stasis. However, the effect of DS in cerebrovascular disease has not been examined experimentally. The protective effects of DS on focal ischemic brain were investigated in a mouse model. DS stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). DS (10-300 mug/mL) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation in mouse aorta, which was significantly attenuated by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME, suggesting that DS causes vasodilation via a NO-dependent mechanism. DS increased resting cerebral blood flow (CBF), although it caused mild hypotension. To investigate the effect of DS on the acute cerebral injury, C57/BL6J mice received 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 22.5 h of reperfusion. DS administered 3 days before arterial occlusion significantly reduced cerebral infarct size by 53.7% compared with vehicle treatment. However, DS did not reduce brain infarction in mice treated with the relatively specific endothelial NOS (eNOS) inhibitor, N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-L-ornithine, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of DS is primarily endothelium-dependent. This correlated with increased phosphorylation of eNOS in the brains of DS-treated mice. DS acutely improves CBF in eNOS-dependent vasodilation and reduces infarct size in focal cerebral ischemia. These data provide causal evidence that DS is cerebroprotective via the eNOS-dependent production of NO, which ameliorates blood circulation.

12872394|t|[Effect of fluticasone inhalation combined with xiaoqinglong decoction on pulmonary function and serum interleukin-16 level in asthma patients].
12872394|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Fluticasone inhalation combined with Xiaoqinglong decoction (XQLD) on pulmonary function and serum interleukin-16 (IL-16) level in asthma patients. METHODS: Fifty-four mild or severe asthma patients were selected and randomly divided into three groups. The treated group was treated with Fluticasone inhalation combined with XQLD, Fluticasone group treated with Fluticasone inhalation, and XQLD group treated with XQLD respectively. Meanwhile ten healthy volunteers were selected as healthy control group. The conventional pulmonary function FEV1 and respiratory impedance R5 were measured before and after 4 weeks treatment. The IL-16 levels were determined by using ELISA. RESULTS: FEV1 were obviously increased and R5 decreased in the three groups after treatment (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but the improvement was more significant in the treated group (P < 0.01). Before treatment, serum levels of IL-16 in all the three groups were significantly higher than those in the healthy control group (P < 0.01) and lowered after treatment respectively, the treated group was significantly lower than those of the other two groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The serum level of IL-16 was negatively correlated with FEV1 and positively with R5(r1 = -0.67, r2 = 0.71, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The effects of Fluticasone inhalation combined with XQLD on pulmonary function and serum IL-16 levels were superior to those of Fluticasone inhalation and XQLD alone in asthma patients. So it could become an important therapeutical method in treating mild and severe asthma patients.

1682293|t|Inhibition by xiao-chai-hu-tang (TJ-9) of development of hepatic foci induced by N-nitrosomorpholine in Sprague-Dawley rats.
1682293|a|The effect of Xiao-chai-hu-tang (TJ-9) on hepatocarcinogenesis induced by N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM) was investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were given normal chow pellets containing 0.5% or 1.0% TJ-9 until the end of the experiment, and drinking water containing NNM for 8 weeks. Pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions staining for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) or the placental type of glutathione-S-transferase (GST-P) were examined histochemically. In Week 15, quantitative histological analysis showed that prolonged treatment with 0.5% TJ-9 significantly reduced the number and volume of GGT-positive and GST-P-positive hepatic lesions. Treatment with 1.0% TJ-9 inhibited the development of GGT-positive and GST-P-positive lesions, but was less effective than 0.5% TJ-9. Administration of 0.5% TJ-9 also caused a significant increase in the proportion of helper T lymphocytes and a significant decrease in the labeling index of pre-neoplastic lesions. These findings indicate that TJ-9 inhibits the development of hepatic foci.

35051605|t|Xiaoyao Powder in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
35051605|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide with alarming prevalence. Due to its complex pathogeneses and considerable individual heterogeneity in disease, there is no specific medication to NAFLD safely and effectively. Therefore, there is a great need to explore complementary and alternative therapies. Xiaoyao Powder (XYP), a classic Chinese formula, has been tremendously applied to gastrointestinal diseases, especially non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the efficacy and safety of XYP have not been fully assessed. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the effectiveness and safety of XYP for NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The assigned registration number on the PROSPERO platform of this meta-analysis is CRD42020192154, and we strictly followed the protocol. We searched eight primary databases from their inception to June 2020. Two authors independently identified random controlled trials (RCTs) of XYP for NAFLD and evaluated the quality of the retrieved articles by Cochrane accessing risk bias tool. At least one of the following indices was thoroughly documented for outcome measurement: total effective rate, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), body mass index (BMI), and adiponectin. We calculated risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) for dichotomous data and continuous variables with a 95% confidence interval (CI). R 4.0.5 software was employed for data synthesis. RESULTS: Consequently, we identified 12 studies with 1012 participants. XYP, whether individually or combined with essential treatment, ameliorated NAFLD regardless of the course of the disease or curative duration. This benefit was mainly driven by regulating levels of serum markers, involving TC, TG, ALT, AST, GGT, and adiponectin. Three studies where statins were concerned about drug safety reported several adverse events with clinical symptoms, varying from flatulence, constipation, and diarrhea to rash, whereas others did not. CONCLUSION: Our findings provided evidence that XYP is a therapeutic option to treat NAFLD effectively and safely. Notwithstanding, a precise and comprehensive conclusion calls for RCTs on a larger scale with more rigorous designs considering the inferior methodological quality and limited retrieved articles.

25264130|t|Acute oral toxicity of Insampaedok-san, a traditional herbal formula, in rats and its protective effects against ovalbumin-induced asthma via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
25264130|a|BACKGROUND: Insampaedok-san (ren-shen-bai-du-san in Chinese) is a traditional herbal formula widely used for the treatment of respiratory diseases in Korea and China. In this study, we investigated the acute oral toxicity of an Insampaedok-san water extract (ISSE) in rats and the antiasthmatic effects of ISSE and its mechanism in a model of asthma induced by ovalbumin (OVA) in mice. METHODS: In a safety study, ISSE was administrated orally to rats of both sexes at single doses of 0 and 5000 mg/kg. We observed body weight changes, mortality, clinical signs, and gross pathological findings. In vitro antioxidant activity of ISSE was measured using 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical scavenging methods. A model of asthma was established in mice by sensitization and challenge with OVA. We assessed the levels of type 2 T-helper cytokines, chemokines, and immunoglobulin levels, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity using a kit. RESULTS: No adverse effects were observed in the acute ISSE toxicity study. ISSE showed potent free radical scavenging activity and inhibited the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lung and mucus hypersecretion in OVA-challenged mice. ISSE significantly decreased levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, eotaxin, and OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E, and increased SOD activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ISSE is safe for human consumption and its antiasthmatic effect is associated with the ability of ISSE to attenuate inflammation and oxidative stress.

8739176|t|Effects of sho-saiko-to on production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and superoxide from peripheral monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells isolated from HIV infected individuals.
8739176|a|The effects of Sho-saiko-to (SST), a traditional Chinese medicine, on the production of PGE2 from monocytes, LTB4 and superoxide from polymorphonuclear cells (PMNC) in HIV infected individuals were studied. SST inhibited the production of PGE2 from monocytes stimulated by opsonized zymosan in all groups including the healthy control group and also inhibited the production of superoxide from PMNC after stimulation with FMLP. On the other hand, SST enhanced the production of LTB4 when PMNC were stimulated by the calcium ionophore A23187. These results suggest that SST has different effects on the production of prostanoids or superoxide from monocytes and PMNC. Furthermore, our data indicates that inhibition of PGE2 or superoxide production will lead to indirect suppression of HIV, and enhancement of LTB4 will contribute to the upregulation of the immune reaction in HIV infected individuals.

23628154|t|Novel pharmacokinetic studies of the Chinese formula Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang in MCAO rats.
23628154|a|Our previous studies showed that after oral administration of an Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT) decoction, there is a higher concentration of the pure components, berberine, baicalin and gardenoside in the plasma of Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats than in sham-operated rats, The aim of the present study was to determine whether these components could be reliably measured in MCAO rat tissues. First, the plasma concentration-time profiles of berberine, palmatine, baicalin, baicalein and gardenoside were characterised in MCAO rats after oral administration of the aqueous extract of HLJDT. Subsequently, liver, lung and kidney tissues were obtained from sudden death MCAO rats in the absorption phase (0.25 h), the distribution phase (1.0 h) and the elimination phase (8.0 h) after administration of the HLJDT aqueous extract. An HPLC method was developed and validated for the determination of the distribution characteristics of berberine, palmatine, baicalin, baicalein and gardenoside simultaneously from the above-mentioned rat tissues. The results indicated that berberine, palmatine, baicalin and baicalein distributed rapidly and accumulated at high levels in the lung, while gardenoside distributed widely in the lung and the kidney. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the distribution of the active ingredients derived from HLJDT in MCAO rat tissues. The tissue distribution results provide a biopharmaceutical basis for the design of the clinic application of HLJDT in cerebrovascular disease.

23183090|t|Rapid-resolution liquid chromatography TOF-MS for urine metabolomic analysis of collagen-induced arthritis in rats and its applications.
23183090|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of autoimmune diseases characterized by persistent synovitis, systemic inflammation and autoantibodies. Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with anti-inflammatory activity. In the present study, a rapid-resolution liquid chromatography tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RRLC-TOF-MS) based metabolomic study was developed to obtain a systematic view of the progression of RA and assess the efficacy of HLJDT and its components in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups, including model group, normal control group, dexamethasone group, HLJDT group and the mixture of 13 components of HLJDT group after immunized with bovine type II collagen. Urine samples for metabolomic study were collected on 8, 15, 22 day during the animal experiment. RESULTS: The pharmacological changes (swelling paws and arthritis scores) showed that prophylactic treatment with HLJDT and its components significantly suppressed the swelling of rats' paws. By combining with partial least squares discriminant analysis, 24 potential biomarkers were identified and primarily involved in 12 metabolism pathways, such as tricarboxylic acids cycle metabolism, lipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism, which revealed a new insight into the RA network in vivo. These potential metabolites identified in CIA model need to be further investigated to prove their diagnostic and/or prognostic values for RA. Taking potential biomarkers found in the study as screening indexes, it revealed that HLJDT and its components could reverse the pathological process of RA through partly regulating the disturbed metabolic pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the metabolomic strategy based on RRLC-TOF-MS is a useful tool to search potential biomarkers related to RA and to dissect the underlying mechanisms of TCM in treating RA.

11789185|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical effect of Danzhi Xiaoyao powder (DZXY) in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) according to Liver in TCM. METHODS: Fifty-one type 2 DM patients were randomly divided into the treated group and the control group, 31 patients of the treated group were treated with conventional and DZXY therapy, while 20 patients in the control were treated with conventional therapy alone. Before and after treatment for 3 months, the levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood cholesterol (CH) and triglycerides (TG) were examined in all the patients. RESULTS: By the end of 3 months, the effect in treating type 2 DM in the treated group was better than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with those before treatment in each group and those of the control, the levels of FBG, fasting insulin, HbA1c after DZXY treatment were reduced (P < 0.05), but levels of CH and TG in all groups had no significant difference. CONCLUSION: DZXY could soothe the Liver to relieve depression, which is effective in treating type 2 DM and could improve the symptoms of DM patients.

35586694|t|Zengye Decoction Attenuated Severe Acute Pancreatitis Complicated with Acute Kidney Injury by Modulating the Gut Microbiome and Serum Amino Acid Metabolome.
35586694|a|Objective: To explore the effect and underlying mechanism of Zengye decoction (ZYD), a traditional formula from China, on the severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) rat model with acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods: The SAP-AKI model was induced by 3.5% sodium taurocholate. Rats were treated with normal saline or ZYD twice and sacrificed at 36 h after modeling. Amylase, lipase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, kidney injury molecule 1(KIM-1), and multiple organs' pathological examinations were used to assess the protective effect of ZYD. Gut microbiome detected by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis and serum amino acid metabolome analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry explained the underlying mechanism. The Spearman correlation analysis presented the relationship between microflora and metabolites. Results: ZYD significantly decreased KIM-1(P < 0.05) and the pathological score of the pancreas (P < 0.05), colon (P < 0.05), and kidney (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, ZYD shifted the overall gut microbial structure (beta-diversity, ANOSIM R = 0.14, P=0.025) and altered the microbial compositions. Notably, ZYD reduced the potentially pathogenic bacteria-Bacteroidetes, Clostridiales vadin BB60 group, and uncultured_Clostridiales_bacterium, but promoted the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers-Erysipelotrichaceae, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Moryella (all P < 0.05). Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) presented a remarkable change in amino acid metabolome after SAP-AKI induction and an apparent regulation by ZYD treatment (R2Y 0.878, P=0.01; Q2 0.531, P=0.01). Spearman's correlation analysis suggested that gut bacteria likely influenced serum metabolites levels (absolute r > 0.4 and FDR P < 0.02). Conclusions: ZYD attenuated SAP-AKI by modulating the gut microbiome and serum amino acid metabolome, which may be a promising adjuvant treatment.

24761117|t|Effect on eNOS/NO Pathway in MIRI rats with preconditioning of GFPC from Dang Gui Si Ni decoction.
24761117|a|OBJECTIVE: In order to discover whether the eNOS/NO (endothelial nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide) pathway is involved in the protective mechanisms of ischemic myocardium of DGSND (Dang Gui Si Ni Decoction) in MIRI (myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury) SD rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We made I/R (ischemia-reperfusion) model by ligating the left anterior-descending branch of the coronary artery (LAD) for 30 min and releasing the ligature for 120 min. eNOS (nitric oxide synthase) mRNA (message ribonucleic acid) and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) mRNA were measured by the methods of real-time RT-PCR (Real time Polychainase Chain Reaction), peNOS (phosphorylated eNOS) and iNOS protein were measured by the means of western blot. RESULTS: In PPC group, real-time RT-PCR and western-blot analysis showed that eNOS mRNA and peNOS protein increased markedly (P < 0.05); iNOS mRNA and protein decreased significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that ischemic preconditioning (IPC) of GFPC from DGSND plays a protective role in I/R heart through regulating the eNOS/NO signal pathway, which could increase the eNOS gene expression and decrease the expression of iNOS mRNA.

35307068|t|[Observation and analysis on clinical efficacy of Dachengqi decoction for acute pancreatitis].
35307068|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of Dachengqi decoction combined with octreotide in the treatment of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). METHODS: From March 2018 to February 2021, a total of 68 patients with mild acute pancreatitis (MAP) and moderately severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP) admitted to Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine-Integrated Hospital were included, and they were randomly divided into western medicine treatment group and Dachengqi decoction group. The patients in the western medicine treatment group received conventional western medicine (octreotide+symptomatic treatment); in the Dachengqi decoction group, 100 mL of Dachengqi decoction was taken orally on the basis of conventional western medicine, twice a day; the observation time for both groups was 7 days. The levels of inflammation parameters [white blood cell count (WBC), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP)] and serum amylase (Amy) before and after treatment of patients between the two groups, as well as the occurrence of clinical efficacy indicators and adverse reactions were compared. RESULTS: Among the 68 included patients, 4 were excluded because the specimen was not obtained or the patient gave up the treatment. A total of 64 patients were finally enrolled in the analysis, including 32 cases in the Dachengqi decoction group and 32 cases in the western medicine treatment group respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in inflammation parameters or serum Amy levels before treatment between the two groups. At 7 days of treatment, the inflammatory parameters and serum Amy levels of the two groups were significantly lower than those before treatment [western medicine treatment group: WBC (x10(9)/L) was 5.94+/-2.08 vs. 11.81+/-3.66, IL-6 (ng/L) was 7.22 (5.72, 14.23) vs. 30.13 (15.77, 85.37), PCT (mug/L) was 0.068 (0.052, 0.128) vs. 0.290 (0.231, 0.428), CRP (mg/L) was 26.0 (18.3, 35.8) vs. 112.0 (62.0, 126.0), Amy (U/L) was 77 (57, 116) vs. 352 (162, 1 576); Dachengqi decoction group: WBC (x10(9)/L) was 5.56+/-2.04 vs. 12.22+/-2.85, IL-6 (ng/L) was 5.70 (3.26, 11.06) was 50.30 (23.99, 88.32), PCT (mug/L) was 0.038 (0.028, 0.808) vs. 0.308 (0.129, 0.462), CRP (mg/L) was 11.0 (3.5, 24.0) vs. 150.0 (75.0. 193.0), Amy (U/L) was 78 (57, 104) vs. 447 (336, 718); all P < 0.05], and the levels of IL-6, PCT, and CRP decreased more significantly after treatment in the Dachengqi decoction group (all P < 0.05). The total clinical effective rate of patients in the Dachengqi decoction group was significantly higher than that of the western medicine treatment group [93.75% (30/32) vs. 71.88% (23/32), P < 0.05]. There was no obvious adverse event during the treatment and observation period in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Dachengqi decoction combined with octreotide therapy could improve the clinical efficacy of AP patients, and its mechanism might be related to reducing the level of inflammatory factors, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory response, and regulating the level of serum Amy.

31405304|t|Literature Review of Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbs-Induced Liver Injury From an Oncological Perspective With RUCAM.
31405304|a|Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs are commonly regarded to be safe with minimal toxicities in Chinese communities. Cancer patients who are receiving Western oncology therapy often concurrently take TCM herbs for anticancer and symptom relief purposes. We performed a literature review for current evidence on TCM herb-induced liver injury from an oncological perspective. A literature search on PubMed was performed to identify publications regarding TCM herbs and concoctions with hepatoprotective or hepatotoxic properties. Lists of commonly used herbs and their causality levels were compiled. In view of the wide range of evidence available, cases assessed by the well-established RUCAM (Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method) algorithm were categorized as the highest level of evidence. More than one case of TCM herb-induced liver injury was confirmed by RUCAM in the following herbs and concoctions: Lu Cha (Camellia sinensis), Bai Xian Pi (Dictamnus dasycarpus), Tu San Qi (Gynura segetum), Jin Bu Huan (Lycopodium serratum), He Shou Wu (Polygoni multiflora), Ge Gen (Pueraria lobata), Dan Lu Tong Du tablet, Shou Wu Pian, Xiao Chai Hu Tang, Xiao Yin pill, and Yang Xue Sheng Fa capsule. Finally, TCM with anticancer or symptom relief uses were discussed in detail with regard to their hepatotoxic or hepatoprotective properties.

9567084|t|[A case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia due to Sho-saiko-to].
9567084|a|A 16-year-boy who had taken a common over-the-counter cold remedy containing Sho-saiko-to, presented with fever, severe cough, sputum and dyspena. Two days later, he was admitted because a negative density, pulmonary edema-like shadow was noted on chest X-ray. A diagnosis of drug-induced pneumonia was strongly suspected, because an arterial blood gas analysis showed severe hypoxemia and leukocytosis with eosinophilia, and the chest X-ray showed a diffuse negative density pulmonary edema like shadow bilaterally. The findings on microscopic examination of transbronchial lung biopsy specimens were compatible with eosinophilic pneumonia. The eosinophil percentage in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was high. The result of a lymphocyte-stimulation test was positive for Sho-saiko-to, and Sho-saiko-to-induced pneumonia was strongly suspected. The patient ceased taking the cold remedy, and prednisolone was given. The clinical symptoms, severe hypoxemia, and chest X-ray findings markedly improved. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of acute eosinophilic pneumonia induced by Sho-saiko-to.

31179723|t|Quercetin is the Active Component of Yang-Yin-Qing-Fei-Tang to Induce Apoptosis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
31179723|a|Yang-Yin-Qing-Fei-Tang (YYQFT) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary emphysema, bronchitis, cytomegaloviral pneumonia, but the mechanisms of the medicine are not clear. This study aimed to identify the active components of YYQFT and elucidate the underlying mechanism on non-small cell lung cancer. First, YYQFT was extracted with different solvents, and then the most effective extract was determined by assessing their effects on non-small cell lung cancer cell growth. Second, several active compounds from YYQFT were identified, and quercetin was the one of the important active ingredients. Subsequently, the in vivo antitumor activity of quercetin was confirmed in a lung cancer xenograft model in mice. 200 mu g/mL quercetin significantly reduced tumor volume without affecting body weight of the mice. Furthermore, induction of apoptosis by quercetin was detected in tumor tissues treated with quercetin. Multiple apoptosis related genes including p53, Bax and Fas were upregulated by quercetin in tumor tissue and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was increased accordingly. Our results demonstrated that quercetin, as the main effective component of the YYQFT, has potent inhibitory activity on non-small cell lung cancer by regulating the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2.

22097211|a|OBJECTIVE: To screen out effective ingredients of Huangqi Decoction (HQD) on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) induced liver fibrosis and its assembling actions. METHODS: (1) DMN solution (0. 5%) was peritoneally injected to rats to prepare the liver fibrosis model for 12 times, starting from the 1st day of modeling to the end of the 4th week. Uniform design method with 4-factor 8-level table was used to optimize the proportion of four ingredients from HQD, including astragaloside (AS), astragalus flavonoids (AF), glycyrrhizae acid (GA), and glycyrrhizae flavonoids (GF). Moreover, the changes of hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in the liver issue and the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in serum were observed as screen indices, and the method of regression analysis was used to find out an optimal combination. (2) A further study for comparing and verifying the efficacy of the obtained optimized prescription was conducted by observing the changes of fibrosis pathology, the content of Hyp in the liver tissue and serum enzyme activity after medication. RESULTS: The optimal proportion of AS and GA was 164:48. Compared with the model group, the content of Hyp in the liver tissue and the levels of ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in serum decreased significantly, indicating the inhibiting effect of HQD and the AS/GA combination group on hepatic fibrosis formation (P<0.05). The AS/GA combination group was better than AS/GA used alone group in reducing the content of Hyp in the liver tissue and the level of ALT in serum. Furthermore, the AS/GA combination group was better than the HQD group in reducing the level of ALT in serum. CONCLUSIONS: AS and GA were effective ingredients of HQD, and the combination of AS and GA had obvious synergistic effect in reducing liver collagen deposition and decreasing serum ALT activity in DMN-induced liver fibrosis.

16696911|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction (XFZYD) on functions of vascular endothelium in patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP). METHODS: Fifty patients with UAP were randomly divided into two groups: XFZYD-treated group with 32 cases and control group with 18 cases. The patients in the control group were given regular therapy, while the patients in the XFZYD-treated group were given XFZYD additionally on the basis of regular therapy. All patients in both groups were treated for 8 weeks. Then the contents of serum endothelin (ET), nitric oxide (NO), soluble vascular cell adhesive molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) were examined by radioimmunoassay, enzymic method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. RESULTS: The total response rate in the XFZYD-treated group was 93.75%, which was significantly higher than 66.67% in the control group (P<0.05). The contents of serum ET, sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 in the XFZYD-treated group were much lower than those in the control group (P<0.01), while the content of serum NO was obviously higher than that in the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: XFZYD can improve the functions of vascular endothelium by lowering the levels of endothelium-derived contracting substances, enhancing the levels of endothelium-derived relaxing substances, and reducing the cell adhesions, and hence to raise the therapeutic effects on UAP.

The result of meta-analysis demonstrated that there was no difference in hemoglobin (Hb) [weighted mean differences (WMD) =-8.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): (-18.64, 1.13), P=0.08], whereas the subgroup analysis showed the difference was significant when the ratio of Radix Astragali to Radix Angelicae Sinensis was 5:1 [WMD =-16.27, 95% CI: (-28.73, -3.80), P=0.01], increase of Hb was more effective in experimental group than control group and the difference was not significant when the ratio of Radix Astragali to Radix Angelicae Sinensis was 5 not equal1 [WMD =-0.57, 95% CI: (-4.52, 3.39), P=0.78]. There were significant differences in red blood cell (RBC) [WMD =-0.49, 95% CI: (-0.69, -0.28), P<0.00001], hematocrit (HCT) [WMD =-1.92, 95% CI: (-3.15, -0.69), P=0.002] and clinical efficacy [odd ratio (OR) =0.30, 95% CI: (0.13, 0.69), P=0.004] between Danggui Buxue Decoction combination group and control group, the experimental group was better than control group. There was no adverse event reported in the experimental group. CONCLUSIONS: Danggui Buxue Decoction in combination with conventional western medicine (CWM) for renal anemia might be superior to CWM alone and there was no adverse event in the experimental group, it might be more effective when the ratio of Radix Astragali to Radix Angelicae Sinensis was 5:1. However, the quality of included studies was not high, and less attention was paid to the safety, high quality randomized controlled trials are needed to further confirm the findings.

30349514|t|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction Ameliorates Hyperglycemia and Insulin Resistant in Association With Gut Microbiota Modulation.
30349514|a|Background: Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD), a prescription of traditional Chinese medicine, has been clinically used to treat diabetes for thousands of years and its mechanism was reported to be related to gut microbiota. However, no study has explored the effect of HLJDD on the gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) yet. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the modulation of gut microbiota induced by HLJDD treatment in T2DM in order to unveil the underlying mechanism. Methods: A combination of high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce T2DM in rats. Bacterial communities in the fecal samples from the control group, the T2DM model group, and the HLJDD-treated T2DM group were analyzed by 16S gene sequencing, followed with a subset sample analyzed by shotgun sequencing. Results: The HLJDD treatment significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia and inflammation in T2DM rats. Additionally, our results indicated that HLJDD treatment could not only restore the gut dysbiosis in T2DM rats, which was proved by an increasing amount of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing and anti-inflammatory bacteria such as Parabacteroides, Blautia, and Akkermansia as well as a decreasing amount of conditioned pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Aerococcus, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium), but also modulate the dysregulated function of gut microbiome in T2DM rats, including an up-regulation in bile acid biosynthesis as well as a reduction in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and nucleotide metabolism. Conclusion: HLJDD treatment could ameliorate hyperglycemia and restore the dysregulated microbiota structure and function to a normal condition mainly by increasing SCFAs-producing bacteria and reducing conditioned pathogenic bacteria in T2DM rats, which provides insights into the mechanism of HLJDD treatment for T2DM from the view of gut microbiota.

7598092|t|Preventive effect of dai-saiko-to (da-chai-hu-tang) extract on disrupted hepatic active oxygen metabolism in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury.
7598092|a|In order to clarify the preventive action of Dai-Saiko-to (Da-Chai-Hu-Tang) extract (TJ-8) on the progression of acute liver injury in rats intoxicated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), we examined the effect of post-oral TJ-8 administration on hepatic active oxygen metabolism following the progression of this liver damage. When TJ-8 (1.0 g/kg body weight) was administered orally to male Wistar rats aged five weeks 2 hrs after i.p. injection of CCl4 (1.0 ml/kg body weight), an apparent liver injury occurred. Significant prevention against the progression of liver injury was found at 24 hrs after injection, judging from the activities of serum transaminases, indexes of liver cell damage. Liver cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased 2 and 24 hrs after CCl4 injection, while liver cytosolic catalase and glutathione reductase (GSSG-R) activities decreased 24 hrs after the injection. At 2 and 24 hrs after CCl4 treatment, liver cytosolic Se-containing glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activity did not change and liver cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) activity increased. Post-oral TJ-8 administration significantly ameliorated decreases in liver SOD, catalase, and GSSG-R activities at 24 hrs after CCl4 injection, but did not affect liver Se-GSH-px and increased liver G-6-PDH activities at 24 hrs after the injection. Although increased liver lipid peroxide level and decreased liver reduced glutathione and ascorbic acid levels were observed 2 and 24 hrs after CCl4 injection, post-oral TJ-8 administration significantly prevented these changes found at 24 hrs after injection. These results indicate that post-oral TJ-8 administration can prevent the progression of acute liver injury in CCl4-injected rats by inhibiting enhanced lipid peroxidation and by improving disrupted active oxygen metabolism in the injured liver.

35388299|t|Mechanism of Sishen-Pill-Regulated Special Memory T and mTfh Cell via Involving JAK/STAT5 Pathway in Colitis Mice.
35388299|a|It is known that memory T cells (mT cell) and memory T follicular cells (mTfh) play vital roles in the IBD pathogenesis. Sishen Pill (SSP) is a classic prescription used to treat chronic ulcerative colitis (UC). However, it is still unclear whether SSP can regulate immune homeostasis induced by mT cell and mTfh to treat IBD. In this study, we measured mT cell and mTfh level to explore the conceivable mechanism of SSP-treated IBD. The mice colitis were induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and were treated by SSP for 7 days. The therapeutic effect of SSP was evaluated by macroscopic and microscopic observation; the mT cell, mTfh, and their subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. Activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was analyzed by using a Western blot. In the present study, SSP significantly reversed weight loss and colonic injury (colon weight increase and colonic length shortening) caused by 3% DSS in physiological saline solution. Flow cytometry showed that the percentages of CD4(+) and CD8(+) expressions on central memory T cells were enhanced after SSP treatment, while the CD4(+) T cm, CD4(+) mTfh (memory T follicular helper) cells and their subpopulations were also significantly increased. Moreover, SSP inhibited the expression of JAK/STAT signaling pathway proteins JAK1, PIAS3, STAT5, p-STAT5, BIM, BAX, caspase-3, and beta-casein and promoted the expression of JAK3, PISA1, Bcl-2, and caveolin-1. In summary, SSP can regulate immune homeostasis induced by mT cell and mTfh in DSS-induced colitis, which is potentially correlated with JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation.

29726648|t|[Effects of Zhibai Dihuang Decoction on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase in the spermatogenic cells of rats with ureaplasma urealyticum infection].
29726648|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of Zhibai Dihuang Decoction (ZDD) on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COX) in the spermatogenic cells of rats with ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) infection. METHODS: From forty 45 months old SD rats, 30 were randomly selected for the establishment of the model of testicular UU infection by inoculating the bladder with UU suspension and the other 10 injected with normal saline as controls (group A). At 7 days after inoculation, the rat models of testicular UU infection were treated orally with normal saline (group B), ZDD at 1 g per kg of the body weight per day (group C), and azithromycin at 0.105 g per kg of the body weight per day (group D), respectively, once daily for 21 days. Then all the animals were sacrificed and the epididymal and testicular tissues collected for examination of sperm motility with the color sperm dynamic detection system, measurement of the COX activity with the immunohistochemical DAB method, and determination of the mRNA expressions of COX and COX by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared with group A, group B showed significant decreases in such sperm parameters as grade a sperm (1.03 +/- 0.09 vs 0.07 +/- 0.03 %, P<0.01), grade b sperm (2.07 +/- 0.52 vs 0.35 +/- 0.13 %, P<0.01), straight line velocity (VSL) (10.95 +/- 0.98 vs 6.78 +/- 1.05 mum/s, P<0.01), curvilinear velocity (VCL) (42.03 +/- 1.35 vs 38.10 +/- 7.65 mum/s, P>0.05), average path velocity (VAP) (16.22 +/- 1.52 vs 10.05 +/- 1.80 mum/s, P<0.01), and the mRNA expressions of COX (2.25 +/- 0.24 vs 0.93 +/- 0.10 %, P<0.01) and (6.72 +/- 0.37 vs 2.95 +/- 0.78 %, P<0.01). After treatment, all the parameters were remarkably increased in groups C and D (grade a sperm: 1.11 +/- 0.30 and 0.60 +/- 0.19%; grade b sperm: 2.40 +/- 0.59 and 1.32 +/- 0.27 %; VSL: 12.11 +/- 1.62 and 11.47 +/- 1.21 mum/s; VCL: 54.30 +/- 2.35 and 45.75 +/- 1.64 mum/s; VAP 18.40 +/- 1.27 and 16.69 +/- 1.02 mum/s; expression of COX mRNA: 1.86 +/- 0.30 and 1.74 +/- 0.17 %) as compared with those in group B (P<0.05or P<0.01) except the COX activity and the expression of COX mRNA (P>0.05), and all the parameters were significantly higher in group C than in D (P<0.05or P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: UU infection can reduce grades a and b sperm, linear, curvilinear and mean sperm velocities, and the mRNA expressions of COX and while ZDD can improve these parameters. The improvement of sperm motility may not be associated with the activity of COX, and the COX activity may be related to the mRNA expression of COX II but not that of COX.

34603467|t|Effect of Huanglian Decoction on the Intestinal Microbiome in Stress Ulcer (SU) Mice.
34603467|a|BACKGROUND: Stress ulcer (SU) is a serious gastrointestinal mucosal lesion under acute stress. Huanglian decoction is a famous traditional Chinese medicine prescription, which has been used to treat digestive system diseases for thousands of years. Many clinical cases have proved that Huanglian decoction has a good effect on SU. Some studies have shown that the intestinal bacteria will be changed accordingly when the gastrointestinal mucosa is damaged. However, there are few published reports on the effect of the intestinal microbiome with SU mice that were treated by Huanglian decoction. In this study, we investigated the effect of the fecal microbiome in mice with SU by the 16S rDNA sequencing technology. METHODS: Male KM mice were induced by cold-restraint stress except for the normal control group and then treated by Huanglian decoction (Group HD) and Esomeprazole magnesium solution (Group ES) separately for 7 days. 16S rDNA sequencing technology analysis was applied to evaluate the changes of bacterial flora in mice feces. And, histopathological methods and molecular biological detection methods were also performed. RESULTS: Huanglian decoction could help to repair the gastric mucosal injury and regulate the relative content of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Moreover, Huanglian decoction could increase the relative abundance of intestinal probiotics in the intestine of mice with SU, especially in Verrucomicrobiae and Akkermansia. CONCLUSIONS: Huanglian decoction might effectively promote the repair of gastrointestinal mucosal injury and regulate the number and species of intestinal bacteria to maintain the stability of gastrointestinal microecology.

32281357|t|[Material basis and molecular mechanism of Dachengqi Decoction in treatment of acute pancreatitis based on network pharmacology].
32281357|a|The network pharmacology was used to investigate the material basis and molecular mechanism of Dachengqi Decoction(DCQD) in the treatment of acute pancreatitis(AP). Potential targets of components from DCQD and relevant pathogenic genes of AP were identified through database retrieval. Then, crucial targets were verified with relevant active chemical components via molecular docking. DAVID database was used to explore the functions and pathways involved in the treatment of AP. A total of 108 components were correlated with 28 targets. Molecular docking showed a strong binding ability of key targets and their corresponding compounds. DAVID enrichment analysis showed 438 biological process, 31 molecular functions, 17 cellular components and 96 KEGG pathways. DCQD may achieve its pharmacological effects through anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, negative regulation of apoptosis and regulation of pancreatic secretion, involving multiple signals, such as IL-17, TNF and NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In this study, it is the first time to use the method of network pharmacology to reveal the molecular mechanism of DCQD in the treatment of AP by multiple components and multi-signaling pathways, which provides a basis for further biological experiments of AP.

35096103|t|Action Mechanism Underlying Improvement Effect of Fuzi Lizhong Decoction on Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Study Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking.
35096103|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to decipher the bioactive compounds and potential mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula Fuzi Lizhong Decoction (FLD) for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) treatment via an integrative network pharmacology approach. METHODS: The candidate compounds of FLD and its relative targets were obtained from the TCMSP and PharmMapper web server, and the intersection genes for NAFLD were discerned using OMIM, GeneCards, and DisGeNET. Then, the PPI and component-target-pathway networks were constructed. Moreover, GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were performed to investigate the potential signaling pathways associated with FLD's effect on NAFLD. Eventually, molecular docking simulation was carried out to validate the binding affinity between potential core components and key targets. RESULTS: A total of 143 candidate active compounds and 129 relative drug targets were obtained, in which 61 targets were overlapped with NAFLD. The PPI network analysis identified ALB, MAPK1, CASP3, MARK8, and AR as key targets, mainly focusing on cellular response to organic cyclic compound, steroid metabolic process, and response to steroid hormone in the biological processes. The KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that 16 signaling pathways were closely correlated with FLD's effect on NALFD with cancer pathways, Th17 cell differentiation, and IL-17 signaling pathways as the most significant ones. In addition, the molecular docking analysis revealed that the core active compounds of FLD, such as 3'-methoxyglabridin, chrysanthemaxanthin, and Gancaonin H, had a high binding activity with such key targets as ALB, MAPK1, and CASP3. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that FLD exerted its effect on NAFLD via modulating multitargets with multicompounds through multipathways. It also demonstrated that the network pharmacology-based approach might provide insights for understanding the interrelationship between complex diseases and interventions of the TCM formula.

32237524|a|In this paper, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry(UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS)-based metabolomics approach was used to explore the mechanism of Danggui Buxue Tang(DBT) in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2 DM). T2 DM mice model was induced by high-sugar and high-fat fodder and streptozotocin(STZ). The routine indexes such as body weight, blood glucose, plasma insulin, IL-6 and related organ indexes were determined. The UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS technique was used to analyze the metabolism profile of serum samples between the control group and model group, and multiple statistical analysis methods including principal component analysis(PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA) were used to screen and identify biomarkers. Metabolic profiling revealed 16 metabolites as the most potential biomarkers distinguishing mice in model group from those in control group. The metabolomics pathway analysis(MetPA) was used to investigate the underlying metabolic pathways. Seven major metabolic pathways such the valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid. Eleven metabolites such as taurocholic acid and palmitic acid were down-regulated in T2 DM mice, and five metabolites such as L-leucine and leukotriene E4 were up-regulated. Moreover, the sixteen biomar-kers of each administration group had a trend of returning to mice in control group. The significantly-altered metabolite levels indicated that DBT can improve the progression of type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin sensitivity, regulating sugar and lipid metabolism disorders, and relieving inflammation.

32058006|t|Pharmacodynamics and metabonomics study of Tianma Gouteng Decoction for treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with liver-yang hyperactivity syndrome.
32058006|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Essential hypertension is a prevalence chronic cardiovascular disease, which is treated by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China. Metabolomics approach has achieved more attention in pharmacology studies of natural products. Tianma Gouteng Decoction (TGD) is effective for the therapeutic of hypertension in China. We aimed to investigate antihypertension effect of TGD on spontaneous hypertension rat (SHR) with live-Yang hyperactivity hypertension (Gan Yang Shang Kang, GYSK) and explore the mechanism by metabolomics method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After establishing the GYSK-SHR model by giving aconite decoction, rats were randomly divided into four groups including model group, TGD qd group (66.88 mg/kg, once a day), TGD bid group (33.44 mg/kg, twice a day), TGD tid group (22.29 mg/kg, three times a day). Blood pressure (BP) and indexes of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS system) were measured. Metabolic profiling of rat plasma samples was performed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, which was analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) to explore the relationship between metabolic pathways and hypertension. RESULTS: To better explain the role of TGD on hypertension, we detected three different frequencies of TGD treatment with equal dosage. TGD reduced the BP in GYSH-SHR model and regulated the serum levels of NE, Ang II, ET, 5-HT, CRP, RENIN and ALD especially at TGD bid group. By UPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis, we found 47 potential biomarkers in GYSK-SHR rats from the plasma metabolites, among which 15 biomarkers were regulated by TGD. Consisted with the antihypertension activity, TGD bid group showed the significantly moderating effect on the regulating biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: TGD exhibited the antihypertensive activity at the frequency of administration twice a day, which had the association with RAAS system and mediated 15 biomarkers by regulating metabolisms of glycerol phospholipid, sphingomyelin, energy and amino acid.

11749818|t|Prophylactic effect of four prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine on alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate and carbon tetrachloride induced toxicity in rats.
11749818|a|AIM: To study the prophylactic effects of four Chinese traditional prescriptions against experimental liver injury. METHODS: Liver toxins, alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) were used to induce acute liver injury. Simo Yin(SMY), Guizhi Fuling Wan (GFW), Xieqing Wan (XQW), and Sini San (SNS) were fed (500 mg/kg, in saline, po) to the rats before toxin administration. All the animals were killed 48 h after toxin insulted. Serum index of liver function and hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) were estimated. Histopathological observation was conducted simultaneously. RESULTS: The rats treated with ANIT exhibited elevations of serum total bilirubin (TBI), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutamate-oxalate- transaminase (GOT), glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase (GPT), as well as cholestasis and parenchyma necrosis. In rats, challenged with ANIT, receiving the pre-treatment of prescriptions of SMY, XQW, and SNS, the biochemical and morphological parameters of liver injury were significantly reduced. The increased LPO level in liver tissue, associated with the provoked serum GOT and GPT levels were the salient features observed in CCl4-insulting rats. Pre-treatment of four prescriptions showed a remarkable protective effect, and also was effective in counteracting the free radical toxicity by bringing about a significant decrease in peroxidative level. CONCLUSION: These recipes ameliorate liver damage induced by both ANIT and CCl4 despite the differences in their mechanisms of injury. Therefore they may be able to exert hepatoprotective effects through more than one mechanism of action because they contained a mixture of anti-hepatotoxic ingredients with mutual reinforcement and assistance.

24871650|t|Traditional Chinese medicine: a treasured natural resource of anticancer drug research and development.
24871650|a|To discover and develop novel natural compounds, active ingredients, single herbs and combination formulas or prescriptions in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with therapeutic selectivity that can preferentially kill cancer cells and inhibit the amplification of cancer without significant toxicity is an important area in cancer therapy. A lot of valuable TCMs were applied as alternative or complementary medicines in the United States and Europe. But these TCMs, as one of the main natural resources, were widely used to research and develop new drugs in Asia. In TCMs, some specific herbs, animals, minerals and combination formulas were recorded and exploited due to their active ingredients and specific natural compounds with antitumor activities. The article focused on the antitumor properties of natural compounds and combination formulas or prescriptions in TCMs, described its influence on tumor progression, angiogenesis, metastasis, and revealed its mechanisms of antitumor and inhibitory action. Among the nature compounds, triptolide, berberine, matrine, oxymatrine, kurarinone and deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT) with specific molecular structures have been separated, purified, and evaluated their antitumor properties in vitro and in vivo. Cancer is a multifactorial and multistep disease, so the treatment effect of combination formulas and prescriptions in TCMs involving multi-targets and multi-signal pathways on tumor may be superior than that of agents targeting a single molecular target alone. Shi Quan Da Bu Tang and Yanshu injection, as well known combination formulas and prescriptions in TCMs, have shown an excellent therapeutic effect on cancer.

31100441|t|Xiaochaihu Decoction reduces hepatic steatosis and improves D-GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in hybrid grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatusmale symbol x Epinephelus fuscoguttatusfemale symbol).
31100441|a|Excessive lipid accumulation and chemical abuse can induce fatty liver diseases in fish, but the underlying mechanism and therapies are unknown. The present study aims to evaluate the effects of Xiaochaihu Decoction (XCHD) on the growth performance, lipid metabolism and antioxidant function of hybrid grouper in vitro and in vivo, and provide evidence as to whether it can be potentially used as a medicine for liver diseases in aquaculture. In vitro, steatosis model of hybrid grouper primary hepatocytes were incubated for 48h in control or lipid emulsion (LE)-containing medium with or without 24h post-treatment with XCHD. XCHD treatment reversed the LE-induced intracellular lipid accumulation, cell viability and hepatocytes morphological structure. In vivo, a total of 300 hybrid grouper with an average initial weight of 25.43+/-0.18g were fed diets containing five graded levels of XCHD at 150-1200mg/kg diet for 8 weeks. After that, a challenge trial was conducted by injection of D-GalN/LPS to induce liver injury. As a result, dietary supplementation with 150-300mg/kg XCHD diets can significant improve growth performance and feed utilization (P<0.05). Dietary XCHD down-regulated the expression of lipogenic-related genes (G6PD, DGAT2 and ME1) and up-regulated lipolysis-related genes (ATGL, PPARalpha and LPL) expression in the liver of hybrid grouper. Livers challenged with D-GalN/LPS exhibited extensive areas of vacuolization with the disappearance of nuclei and the loss of hepatic architecture. These pathological alterations were ameliorated by XCHD treatment. XCHD significantly down-regulated the D-GalN/LPS induced apoptosis-related genes caspase-3, caspase-9 and p53 mRNA expression and up-regulated the antioxidant-related genes CAT and MnSOD mRNA expression in dose dependent manner, respectively. XCHD potently reduced hepatic lipid accumulation and enhanced antioxidant capability in hybrid grouper and may be a potential fish-feed additive to prevent fatty liver diseases onset and progression.

35286247|t|Banxia-Houpu decoction diminishes iron toxicity damage in heart induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia.
35286247|a|CONTEXT: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) causes chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), which results in mitochondrial dysfunction and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the heart. Excessive free iron could accelerate oxidative damage, which may be involved in this process. Banxia-Houpu decoction (BHD) was reported to improve the apnoea hypopnoea index in OSA patients, but the specific mechanism was still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether BHD could reduce CIH-induced heart damage by regulating iron metabolism and mitochondrial function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6N mice were randomly divided into control, CIH and BHD groups. Mice were exposed to CIH (21 - 5% O2, 20 times/h, 8 h/d) and administered BHD (3.51, 7.01 and 14.02 g/kg, intragastrically) for 21 d. Cardiac and mitochondrial function, iron levels, apoptosis and mitophagy were determined. RESULTS: BHD (7.01 g/kg) significantly improved cardiac dysfunction, pathological change and mitochondrial structure induced by CIH. BHD increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio (1.4-fold) and inhibited caspase 3 cleavage in CIH mice (0.45-fold). BHD activated mitophagy by upregulating Parkin (1.94-fold) and PINK1 (1.26-fold), inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. BHD suppressed ROS generation by decreasing NOX2 (0.59-fold) and 4-HNE (0.83-fold). BHD reduced the total iron in myocardial cells (0.72-fold) and mitochondrial iron by downregulating Mfrn2 (0.81-fold) and MtFt (0.78-fold) proteins, and upregulating ABCB8 protein (1.33-fold). Rosmarinic acid, the main component of Perilla Leaf in BHD, was able to react with Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) in vitro. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings encourage the use of BHD to resist cardiovascular injury and provide the theoretical basis for clinical treatment in OSA patients.

33119909|t|Mitochondria metabonomics of Huangqi Jianzhong Tang against chronic atrophic gastritis.
33119909|a|Huangqi Jianzhong Tang (HQJZ) is a representative prescription used for clinical treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) in Chinese medicine. Our previous study had revealed that energy regulation was one of the important mechanisms of HQJZ action against CAG. In this study, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-Exactive mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive MS) based metabonomics was used to find the potential mitochondrial biomarkers and metabolic pathways of HQJZ in CAG rats, which focused on a specific organelle (mitochondria) isolated from gastric tissue samples. A total of 16 biomarkers from CAG tissues were identified with 11 of these significantly regulated by HQJZ treatment. These biomarkers was mainly involved in glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis metabolism; and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. Our results show that HQJZ could protect from CAG by altering the mitochondrial function. These findings deepen our understanding of the mitochondrial metabolic changes that occur with CAG and shine a light on the mechanism of HQJZ.

15975305|t|Follow-up efficacy of integrative Chinese and Western drugs on localized scleroderma with vitamine B6 and Xuefu Zhuyu decoction.
15975305|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effects of vitamine B(6) (Vit B(6)) and Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction (XFZY, for activating blood circulation to remove stasis) in patients with localized scleroderma(LSD). METHODS: Thirty-three patients were treated with XFZY and Vit B(6), with 15 cases taking orally prednisone acetate and 20 healthy volunteers as the control. Their level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the patients with LSD before and after treatment were observed. RESULTS: The level of sIL-2R and TNF-alpha in the serum from the patients with LSD were higher than those of healthy volunteers (P < 0.01). After treatment with Vit B(6) and XFZY, the level of sIL-2R and TNF-alpha from the patients with LSD decreased significantly (P < 0.01), but there were no difference between the group taking Vit B(6) plus XFZY and the group given prednisone. CONCLUSION: The activating blood circulation to remove stasis approach in treating LSD with integrative Chinese and Western drugs got better results, and metabolic disorder of tryptophan might be correlated with the etiology of LSD.

30274192|t|Galgeun-tang Attenuates Cigarette Smoke and Lipopolysaccharide Induced Pulmonary Inflammation via IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB Signaling.
30274192|a|Galgeun-tang water extract (GGWE) is used to treat various diseases such as the common cold, eczema and asthma in China and Korea. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of GGWE using a cigarette smoke (CS)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced induced pulmonary inflammation mouse model. The mice were exposed to CS for a total of seven days (eight cigarettes per day for 1 h) and LPS was administered intranasally to mice on day 4. GGWE was administered by oral gavage at doses of 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg 1 h before exposure to CS. GGWE decreased inflammatory cell counts, and expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from mice exposed to CS and LPS. GGWE reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), as well as the phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-B subunit alpha (IkappaBalpha) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) in CS- and LPS-exposed mice. Histological examinations revealed that GGWE suppressed inflammatory cell infiltration into lung tissue compared to untreated CS- and LPS-exposed mice. In conclusion, GGWE effectively suppressed CS- and LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. Our results indicate that GGWE may be used as a protective drug to control pulmonary inflammation diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

26446078|t|The Chinese medicine Sini-San inhibits HBx-induced migration and invasiveness of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
26446078|a|BACKGROUND: Sini-San (SNS) is a formulation of four Traditional Chinese Drugs that exhibits beneficial therapeutic effects in liver injury and hepatitis. However, there are no reports describing its effects on the hepatitis B X-protein (HBx)-induced invasion and metastasis in hepatoma cells, and the detailed molecular mechanisms of its actions are still unclear. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying SNS-mediated inhibition of HBx-induced cell invasion and the inhibition of secreted and cytosolic MMP-9 production, using gelatin zymography and Western blot analysis in a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Relative luciferase activity was assessed for MMP-9, NF-kappaB, or AP-1 reporter plasmid-transfected cells. RESULTS: SNS suppressed MMP-9 transcription by inhibiting activator protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity. SNS suppressed HBx-induced AP-1 activity through inhibition of phosphorylation in the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. SNS also suppressed HBx-induced inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation through IkappaB and suppressed HBx-induced activation of ERK/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt upstream of NF-kappaB and AP-1. CONCLUSIONS: SNS suppresses the invasiveness and metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by inhibiting multiple signal transduction pathways.

24070657|t|The molecular and electrophysiological mechanism of buyanghuanwu decoction in learning and memory ability of vascular dementia rats.
24070657|a|Buyanghuanwu Decoction (BYHWD), as a traditional Chinese medicine, has been developed to treat vascular dementia for hundreds of years, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this research, the protective effects of BYHWD on hippocampal neuron were examined in the rats of ischemia-reperfusion. Ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by the four-vessel occlusion method and continued for 30 days. BYHWD (per 6.25g/kg/d) was orally given to rats twice each day for 30 days after ischemia-reperfusion, Nimodipine (per 10mg/kg/d) was orally given to rats twice each day for 30 days. In VD+BYHWD group rats, the neuronal injury in the hippocampal CA1 region was significantly less than that of VD group's. BYHWD of intragastric administration also markedly increased the expression of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseII (CaMKIIIy)in the CA1 region. Our results suggested that increased ERK2 and CaMKIIIy due to BYHWD may partially account for its effect of neuroprotection standing against ischemic injury in the hippocampal CA1 region, and participated in the rebuilding of synapse, strengthened the expression of LTP, promoted the ability recover of learning and memory in VD rats.

26509423|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Here, we examined the combined protective effects of Chinese herbal formula Si-Wu-Tang and Er-Miao-San on hyperuricemia and renal impairment in rats. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into normal rats, hyperuricemic rats, and hyperuricemic rats orally administrated with benzbromarone (4.5 mg.kg(-)(1).d(-)(1)), Si-Wu-Tang (3.78 g.kg(-)(1).d(-)(1)) and Si-Wu-Tang plus Er-Miao-San (6.48 g.kg(-)(1).d(-)(1)) for 4 weeks. Hyperuricemic rats were orally gavaged with adenine (0.1 g.kg(-)(1).d(-)(1)) and potassium oxonate (1.5 g.kg(-)(1).d(-)(1)) daily for 4 weeks. Serum uric acid, creatinine, total cholesterol (TCH), triglyceride and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations, as well as urinary uric acid and microalbuminuria were measured weekly. Serum xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity and renal histopathology were also evaluated. The renal expression of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1) and organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) was detected by western blot. RESULTS: Si-Wu-Tang plus Er-Miao-San lowered serum uric acid, creatinine, triglyceride and BUN levels to a greater degree than did Si-Wu-Tang alone. Si-Wu-Tang plus Er-Miao-San ameliorated microalbuminuria and renal histopathology, as well as decreased serum TCH concentration and XOD activity in hyperuricemic rats. Combination of Si-Wu-Tang and Er-Miao-San also led to a greater increase in OAT1 and OAT3 expression than did Siwutang alone. CONCLUSION: Si-Wu-Tang and Er-Miao-San synergistically ameliorated hyperuricemia and renal impairment in rats through upregulation of OAT1 and OAT3.

31293341|t|Freeze-dried Si-Ni-San powder can ameliorate high fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
31293341|a|BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease worldwide. However, to date, there is no ideal therapy for this disease. AIM: To study the effects of Si-Ni-San freeze-dried powder on high fat diet-induced NAFLD in mice. METHODS: Twenty-four male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into three groups of eight. The control group (CON) was allowed ad libitum access to a normal chow diet. The high fat diet group (FAT) and Si-Ni-San group (SNS) were allowed ad libitum access to a high fat diet. The SNS group was intragastrically administered Si-Ni-San freeze-dried powder (5.0 g/kg) once daily, and the CON and FAT groups were intragastrically administered distilled water. After 12 wk, body weight, liver index, visceral fat index, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), portal lipopoly-saccharide (LPS), liver tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and liver triglycerides were measured. Intestinal microbiota were analyzed using a 16S r DNA sequencing technique. RESULTS: Compared with the FAT group, the SNS group exhibited decreased body weight, liver index, visceral fat index, serum ALT, portal LPS, liver TNF-alpha and liver triglycerides (P < 0.05). Intestinal microbiota analysis showed that the SNS group had different bacterial composition and function compared with the FAT group. In particular, Oscillospira genus was a bacterial biomarker of SNS group samples. CONCLUSION: The beneficial effects of Si-Ni-San freeze-dried powder on high fat diet-induced NAFLD in mice may be associated with its anti-inflammatory and changing intestinal microbiota effects.

27825337|t|Reno-protective effect and mechanism study of Huang Lian Jie Du Decoction on lupus nephritis MRL/lpr mice.
27825337|a|BACKGROUND: Huang Lian Jie Du Decoction (HLJDD), a very famous traditional Chinese medicinal prescription, has been used for heat dissipation and detoxification in China. This study was aimed to evaluate the reno-protective effects of HLJDD against lupus nephritis (LN) in vivo in MRL/lpr mice. METHODS: Animals were administered orally every day for eight consecutive weeks except the mice of normal group and model group. Organ indexes, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and the anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody were tested, respectively. Creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and urine protein were measured for renal function evaluation. The expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT 3) in kidney tissue was observed by western blot (WB) and immunohistochemical (IHC) method. Meanwhile, histopathological changes in the renal were studied by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. RESULTS: The mice of HLJDD-treated group exhibited a significant reduced mortality (p < 0.05), serum anti-dsDNA level (p < 0.05) and renal immune complex deposition (p < 0.05), compared with the untreated MRL/lpr mice. In addition, HLJDD treatment remarkably reduced the levels of BUN, Cr, proteinuria (p < 0.01) and the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-gamma (p < 0.01). Moreover, HLJDD significantly suppressed the phosphorylations of STAT 3 (p < 0.05) and the renal pathological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The study implied that HLJDD may be a potential agent for the therapy of LN, and the down-regulated p-STAT 3 expression suggesting that it may be one of the LN therapy targets for HLJDD.

8220325|t|Preventive effects of a traditional Chinese medicine (sho-saiko-to) against oxygen toxicity and membrane damage during endotoxemia.
8220325|a|The preventive effects of a traditional Chinese medicine Sho-saiko-to (Kampo prescription, TJ-9) were determined from oxygen toxicity and membrane damage in liver during endotoxemia. The liver lipid peroxide level and xanthine oxidase activity 18 h after administration of endotoxin (6 mg/kg, i.p.) to TJ-9 (500 mg/kg/d, p.o.)-pretreated mice were markedly lower than that in endotoxin-treated mice, whereas the administration of TJ-9 significantly increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxide activities in liver of endotoxin-injected mice. In the mice pretreated with a TJ-9, the levels of alpha-tocopherol and nonprotein SH in liver tissue 18 h after endotoxin injection were markedly increased as compared to those in endotoxin-treated mice. Leakages of acid phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase isozyme in serum were markedly lower in endotoxin-TJ-9-treated mice than those in mice given endotoxin. The administration of TJ-9 clearly prevented the membrane protein damage arising from endotoxin challenge. Kampo prescription Sho-saiko-to thus appears to protect the liver plasma membrane from injury by free radicals which occur in a tissue ischemic state during endotoxemia.

10598879|t|Accelerated recovery from cyclophosphamide-induced leukopenia in mice administered a Japanese ethical herbal drug, Hochu-ekki-to.
10598879|a|The effect of a Japanese ethical herbal drug, Hochu-ekki-to (HOT), on recovery from leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide (CY) was investigated. Daily oral administration of 1000 mg/kg HOT into CY-treated mice significantly prevented decrease of leukocyte numbers in the peripheral blood and accelerated recovery from leukopenia. Ginsenoside Rgl extracted from Ginseng radix, a major herb of HOT, was one of the active ingredients. HOT increased numbers of neutrophils and monocytes in the peripheral blood compared with CY-treated control. Moreover, HOT augmented the resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The number of colony-forming units in the spleen (CFU-S) also increased in HOT-treated mice. The frequencies of IL-3-, GM-CSF- and IFN-gamma-producing cells increased in the spleen, bone marrow, liver and IEL on HOT treatment, and HOT clearly augmented the expressions of IL-3, GM-CSF and IFN-gamma mRNA in the spleen, bone marrow, liver and IEL except IL-3 and IFN-gamma mRNA in the IEL. These results suggest that HOT enhances the production of hematopoietic lymphokines, stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and consequently accelerates recovery from leukopenia in CY-treated mice. Additionally, IFN-gamma which HOT-augmented the production may contribute the protective effect against the bacterial infection by activating of phagocyte cells.

31972322|t|Wu-Mei-Wan ameliorates chronic colitis-associated intestinal fibrosis through inhibiting fibroblast activation.
31972322|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Wu-Mei-Wan (WMW), a classic traditional Chinese herb medicine, is one of the most important formulations to treat digestive diseases from ancient times to the present. Previous study showed that WMW has satisfactory curative effects on experimental colitis, which motivating the application of WMW on colitis-associated complications. AIM OF THE STUDY: Intestinal fibrosis is usually considered to be a common complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD). Currently, no effective preventive measures or medical therapies are available for that. This work was designed to evaluate the effect and related mechanism of WMW on chronic colitis-associated intestinal fibrosis mice model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chronic colitis-associated intestinal fibrosis mice model was established by weekly intrarectal injection of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The mice survival rate, disease activity index (DAI), colon length and histological score were examined to assess the therapeutic effect of WMW. Masson's trichrome staining, hydroxyproline assay, immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis were used to evaluate fibrosis level. Colon inflammation was determined by ELISA and immunofluorescence staining. Immunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate fibroblasts proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the expression of key molecules in fibrosis was analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: Here we showed that WMW alleviates chronic colitis with improved survival rate, DAI, colon length and histological score. WMW inhibited the progression of intestinal fibrosis, decreased the expression of various fibrosis markers, such as alpha-SMA, collagen I, MMP-9 and fibronectin. In addition, WMW treatment reduced cytokines IL-6 and IFN-gamma, and downregulated proinflammatory NF-kappaBp65 and STAT3 signaling pathways. Importantly, administration of WMW led to the inhibition of colon fibroblast proliferation and EMT, which are important mediators during fibrosis. Several key profibrotic pathways, including TGF-beta/Smad and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways, were downregulated by WMW treatment. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrated that WMW can prevent intestinal fibrosis and the mechanisms involved may be related to the inhibition of colon fibroblasts activation.

32153068|t|Chinese herbal medicine reduces the risk of urinary incontinence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A population-based retrospective cohort study.
32153068|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of urinary incontinence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance Research Database. From a cohort of 1 million records between 1996 and 2013, a total of 202 279 patients with newly onset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were initially recruited. We matched with propensity score 3967 patients who received Chinese herbal medicine by age, sex, year of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis, urbanization, comorbidities and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medications. All participants received follow-up visits until the end of 2013 to record the incidence rate of urinary incontinence. The Cox proportional hazards model was applied to assess the association between Chinese herbal medicine use and the risk of urinary incontinence among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. RESULTS: The incidence rates of urinary incontinence were 57.33 and 108.15 (per 10 000 person-years) in the Chinese herbal medicine and non-Chinese herbal medicine cohorts, respectively, showing a significantly lower risk of urinary incontinence in Chinese herbal medicine users (aHR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.45-0.69, P < 0.001). The Chinese herbal medicine prescription pattern analysis showed that Fritillariae thunbergii bulbus (Zhebeimu), Semen armeniacae amarum (Kuxingren), Platycodonis radix (Jiegeng), Xiao Qing Long Tang and Ding Chuan Tang constituted the core of Chinese herbal medicine prescriptions applied to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CONCLUSION: The use of Chinese herbal medicine in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients can reduce their risk of urinary incontinence.

34017377|t|Network pharmacology-guided mechanism study uncovers inhibitory effect of Mahuang Decoction on lung cancer growth by impeding Akt/ERK signaling pathways.
34017377|a|Lung cancer (LC) ranks the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, due partially to the unsatisfactory therapeutic effect of the mainstream treatment. Alternatively, Chinese herb medicine (CHM) offers a bright perspective for treating complex diseases. Mahuang Decoction (MHD), a classic CHM formula, has been widely used in treating respiratory diseases in China for centuries, but its action mechanism has yet to be fully investigated. In this study, we first systemically explore the action mechanism of MHD by using network pharmacology and bioinformatic analysis tools, which uncovered a potential "new use of old drug" for MHD in cancer treatment. The therapeutic effect of MHD on LC was then validated by oral administration of MHD in the immunodeficient mice bearing xenografted LC tumors. To better understand the pharmacological activity of MHD against LC, we next constructed a drug/disease-target PPI network composed of 252 putative core therapeutic targets of MHD using Cytoscape. The subsequent enrichment analysis for these targets suggested that MHD could affect the apoptosis and cell cycle of LC cells via impeding Akt/ERK signaling pathways. Notably, these in silico analysis results were further validated by a series of cellular functional and molecular biological assays. Thus, our results show that MHD holds a great potential in LC treatment.

24515912|t|Clinical efficacy and sEMG analysis of a new traditional Chinese medicine therapy in the treatment of spasticity following apoplectic hemiparalysis.
24515912|a|To investigate the clinical effect and surface electromyography (sEMG) of rehabilitation exercise therapy in combination with total glucosides form Shaoyao Gancao decoction in treating spasticity after apoplectic hemiparalysis. Composite spasticity scale (CSS), Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) and modified Barthel index were compared between the exercise only group and the combined therapy group before and 1 month after the treatment to scale muscular tension, function and activities of daily living. Meanwhile, integrate EMG and root mean square (RMS) were used to detect the tension of upper limbs (biceps brachii) and ankles (tibialis anterior muscle and gastrocnemius) after the 1-month treatment. In the combined therapy group, the Ashworth and CSS scales were significantly improved compared to before the treatment (P < 0.05) and compared to the patients in the control group (P < 0.05). After the 1-month treatment, the combined therapy group showed significantly higher FMA and BI scores (P < 0.05) compared to the control group. For the combined therapy group, the sEMG was significantly improved at 1 month after the treatment (P < 0.05), while the control group only showed relatively slight improvement in the RMS of the tibialis anterior muscle and the gastrocnemius. The total glucosides form Shaoyao Gancao decoction could significantly improve the efficacy of the rehabilitation exercise therapy in the treatment of spasticity after apoplectic hemiparalysis, and its mechanism might involve the decrease of muscular tension.

24941835|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of treating chronic persistent bronchial asthma (CPBA) children with abnormal myocardial enzyme spectrum (AMES) by Yupingfeng Powder (YP) combined routine therapy. METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2012, 156 CPBA children patients with AMES were randomly assigned to the treatment group (80 cases) and the control group (76 cases). All patients received routine treatment (inhaled corticosteroids and/or leukotriene regulator). Besides, those in the treatment group took YP. The treatment duration was 3 months. The scores of children asthma control test (C-ACT), pulmonary function (FEV,% and PEF%), myocardial enzyme spectrum were observed before and after treatment, and 3 months before and after treatment. The myocardial enzyme spectrum of 40 healthy children at the baby clinics during the same period were recruited as the control. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), creatine kinase(CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased in the two treatment groups (P <0.01), but there was no statistical difference in AST (P >0.05). Compared with before treatment in the same group, CK-MB, CK, LDH, and AST decreased in the treatment group after treatment and 3 months after treatment (P <0.01). CK-MB, CK, LDH, and AST decreased in the control group 3 months after treatment (P <0.01, P <0.05).Compared with after treatment, CK decreased in the control group 3 months after treatment (P <0.01). C-ACT score, FEV(1),%, and PEF% all increased in the two groups after treatment and 3 months after treatment (P <0.01, P <0.05). Compared with after treatment in the same group, CK decreased in the control group 3 months after treatment (P <0. 01). Compared with the control group in the same period, post-treatment CK-MB and CK decreased (P <0. 01, P <0. 05), while post-treatment C-ACT score, FEV, %, and PEF% increased (P <0.05) in the treatment group (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: YP could strengthen specific and non-specific immunity of the organism, and improve clinical symptoms and the level of myocardial enzyme spectrum.

35242210|t|Zhibai Dihuang Pill Alleviates Ureaplasma urealyticum-Induced Spermatogenic Failure and Testicular Dysfunction via MAPK Signaling Pathway.
35242210|a|The testicles and sperm are extremely susceptible to inflammation and oxidative stress. Although Zhibai Dihuang Pill (ZDP) has been reported to treat various infertilities including male infertility induced by Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) infection, its mechanism is still poorly understood. This study is aimed at clarifying the underlying mechanism of ZDP to protect against UU-infected male infertility. We found that UU-infected infertile rats exhibited weight loss, reduced food intake, and decreased sperm count and vitality. The administration of ZDP improved the general state and sperm motility of rats. In addition, UU infection led to spermatogenesis disorders, impaired secretory function and blood-testis barrier (BTB) of Sertoli cells, and elevated inflammation and oxidative stress. As expected, ZDP suppressed inflammation and oxidative stress to alleviate spermatogenesis disorders. Our research showed that ZDP could improve spermatogenesis disorders and testicular function primarily through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. ZDP exerts its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects via the MAPK signaling pathway, thus playing an important role in ameliorating spermatogenesis failure and testicular dysfunction.

29857298|t|Dangguishaoyao-San attenuates LPS-induced neuroinflammation via the TLRs/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
29857298|a|INTRODUCTION: Dangguishaoyao-San (DSS) is composed of six traditional Chinese medicines, including Angelica sinensis, Paeoniae radix, Rhizoma Ligusticum, Poria cocos, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, and Rhizoma Alismatis. DSS has been reported to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of DSS in vitro using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BV-2 cells were pretreated with 0.58-1.16mg/mL of DSS for 2h and then treated with 1mug/mL LPS for 24h. Cell viability was determined by an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The protein expression levels were measured by Western blots. Inflammatory factors were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The mRNA levels of inflammatory factors were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: DSS treatment at concentrations of 0.58-1.16mg/mL resulted in no significant cytotoxicity. DSS attenuated the release of pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), iNOS and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. DSS attenuated the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TLR2, and TLR4 and decreased TLR4 and TLR protein levels as well as the phosphorylation of IkappaB in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. DSS also down-regulated the nuclear translocation of p65. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that DSS has a protective effect on neuroinflammation in LPS-induced BV-2 microglia cells through the TLRs/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

11263275|t|Effects of huang qi wu wu decoction on plasma proteins in 70 cases of chronic pulmonary heart disease.
11263275|a|Simple immune agar diffusion test was used to assay the contents of 12 plasma proteins in 70 cases of chronic pulmonary heart disease treated by Huang Qi Wu Wu Decoction ([symbol: see text]), with the other 70 cases who were not given Huang Qi Wu Wu Decoction as the control group. The total clinical effective rate in the treatment group was 90.0%, while that in the control group was 75.7%, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). In the treatment group, the levels of prealbumin, transferrin and fibronectin elevated obviously after treatment, and the contents of C-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein decreased markedly (P < 0.01). In the control group, only the levels of ceruloplasmin and C-reactive protein decreased significantly (P < 0.05). It is shown that Huang Qi Wu Wu Decoction may enhance the therapeutic effects for pulmonary heart disease, regulate the metabolism of plasma proteins, and improve the life quality of the patients.

35481834|t|Gut Microbiota Mediates the Protective Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula Qiong-Yu-Gao against Cisplatin-Induced Acute Kidney Injury.
35481834|a|Our previous study found that Qiong-Yu-Gao (QYG), a traditional Chinese medicine formula derived from Rehmanniae Radix, Poria, and Ginseng Radix, has protective effects against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, the potential role of gut microbiota in the nephroprotective effects of QYG was investigated. We found that QYG treatment significantly attenuated cisplatin-induced AKI and gut dysbiosis, altered the levels of bacterial metabolites, with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetic acid and butyric acid increasing and uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate reducing, and suppressed histone deacetylase expression and activity. Spearman's correlation analysis found that QYG-enriched fecal bacterial genera Akkermansia, Faecalibaculum, Bifidobacterium, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group were correlated with the altered metabolites, and these metabolites were also correlated with the biomarkers of AKI, as well as the indicators of fibrosis and inflammation. The essential role of gut microbiota was further verified by both the diminished protective effects with antibiotics-induced gut microbiota depletion and the transferable renal protection with fecal microbiota transplantation. All these results suggested that gut microbiota mediates the nephroprotective effects of QYG against cisplatin-induced AKI, potentially via increasing the production of SCFAs, thus suppressing histone deacetylase expression and activity, and reducing the accumulation of uremic toxins, thereby alleviating fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in renal tissue. IMPORTANCE Cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury is the main limiting factor restricting cisplatin's clinical application. Accumulating evidence indicated the important role of gut microbiota in pathogenesis of acute kidney injury. In the present study, we have demonstrated that gut microbiota mediates the protective effects of traditional Chinese medicine formula Qiong-Yu-Gao against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. The outputs of this study would provide scientific basis for future clinical applications of QYG as prebiotics to treat cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, and gut microbiota may be a promising therapeutic target for chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity.

20547220|t|Zhen-wu-tang, a blended traditional Chinese herbal medicine, ameliorates proteinuria and renal damage of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy in rats.
20547220|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zhen-wu-tang (ZWT) is a blended traditional Chinese medicine specifically used for various kidney diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study is to evaluate the effects of ZWT on diabetic nephropathy and investigate the potential anti-diabetic mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were orally administrated ZWT (80,320 mg/kg b.w.) once a day, for a period of 12 weeks. Body weight, urinary volume, urine protein and blood biochemical parameters were measured every 3 weeks. At the end of the observation period, kidneys were isolated for histology, angiotensin II content determination, real time PCR and Western blot analyses. RESULTS: ZWT (320 mg/kg b.w.) prevented body weight loss, reduced polyurea, urinary protein excretion, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, although it did not alter the hyperglycemia. It ameliorated glomerular hypertrophy and expansion of the mesangial area, swell and effacement of foot process. It also suppressed the increased expression of angiotensin II, nephrin and podocin. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study suggest that ZWT possess a protective effect on renal damage of STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy in rats, by suppressing hyperactivity of renal renin-angiotensin system that turns in to modulate renal nephrin and podocin expressions, thereby protecting podocyte from injury.

2377938|t|[The effect of bakumondo-to on salivary secretion in Sjogren syndrome].
2377938|a|The effect of a traditional chinese medicine 'Bakumondo to' was evaluated on salivary secretion in thirty-eight patients with Sjogren's syndrome (SjS) and the results were compared with a matchen control group of patients treated with Hochuekki-to. Hochuekki-to is also one of the traditional chinese medicine. Tsumura Bakumondo-to and Tsumura Hochuekki-to (extract granules) were used. Daily dose was 9g and 7.5g respectively. Before looking into the effects of Bakumondo-to on salivary secretion, we must define the reliability of the gum test. To avoid of learning effect, three sequential gum tests were needed. At the second gum test and the third gum test, no increase of salivary secretion was observed. So, we performed at least three gum test in each the patients studied. We have reached the following conclusion. First, in the Bakumondo-to group the salivary secretion was significantly increased from 8.2 +/- 1.1ml (m +/- SE) to 11.4 +/- 1.4ml. (p less than 0.005) Second, in the Bakumondo-to group, the increase in salivary secretion was 3.16 +/- 0.78ml which was significantly more than the increase in control group. (p less than 0.005) Third, in the course of long-term observation, the salivary secretion in patients under Bakumondo-to treatment gradually increased. (r = 0.7290) Fourth, the improvement of salivary secretion under Bakumondo-to treatment was marked in stage I and stage II of sialographical abnormalities of the salivary gland. Finally, Bakumondo-to was very useful for managing oral manifestations in patients with SjS.

26043575|a|OJECTIVE: To observe the effect of tianma gouteng decoction (TGD) on the endothelial function and the renal protein expression of spontaneously hypertensive rats, and to analyze its possible mechanism. METHODS: Totally 18 6-week-old SHR were randomly divided into 3 groups according to randomized block design, the SHR control group, the TGD group, and the captopril group, 6 in each group. Meanwhile, Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats of the same age were recruited as a WKY control group. Rats in the TGD group were administered with TGD at the daily dose of 10. 260 g/kg. Rats in the captopril group were administered with captopril at the daily dose of 3. 375 g/kg. 2 mL/100 g distilled water was administered to rats in the SHR control group and the WKY control group. All medication was performed by gastrogavage once per day till rats were 24 weeks old. Changes of blood pressure were measured once per two weeks. The relaxation of the thoracic aorta and the superior mesenteric artery was determined by vascular ring in vitro to reflect the endothelial function. The total renal protein was separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). The significantly deviated protein was verified by Western blot. RESULTS: (1) Compared with the SHR control group, blood pressure was significantly lowered in rats (10 - 24 weeks old) of the captopril group (P <0.01, P <0.05). The hypotensive effect of TGD was obvious at the beginning of hypertension (10 -12 weeks) (P <0. 01). But along with the progression of hypertension, its hypotensive effect was not obvious (P>0. 05). (2) Compared with the SHR control group, the relaxation of the superior mesenteric artery was obviously improved in the TGD group (P <0. 05); the relaxation of the thoracic aorta and the superior mesenteric artery was obviously superior in the WKY control group (P <0. 01, P <0. 05). But there was no statistical difference in each relaxation index between the captopril group and the SHR control group (P >0. 05).(3) RESULTS: of 2-DE found 16 significantly differential renal protein, mainly involved nitric oxide (NO) system, oxidative stress, and cytoskeleton-related proteins. Results of Western blot showed that TGD could significantly improve expressions of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), N(G, N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2 (DDAH2), and pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase 1 (PCBD1) (P <0. 05). CONCLUSION: GTD could protect the endothelial function of the superior mesenteric artery in SHR, and its intervention mechanism of hypertension induced early renal injury might be relevant to regulating the NO system and antioxidative stress.

18522681|t|Huang-lian-jie-du-tang, a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in human liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
18522681|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Huang-lian-jie-du-tang (HLJDT; Japanese name, oren-gedoku-to) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription known to possess anti-inflammatory activity. Our study reports here for the first time the anticancer effect of HLJDT in two human liver cancer cell lines, Hep G2 and PLC/PRF/5. METHODS: Inhibition of cell proliferation by HLJDT was measured by sodium 3'-(1-(phenylamino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium)-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene-sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) assay. Clonogenic assay was used to elucidate the possible differences in long-term effects of HLJDT on human liver cancer cells. Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was detected using electrophoresis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick endlabeling (TUNEL) assay. Protein expressions were determined by immunoblot assay. The activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) was determined by Trans-AM ELISA kit. In vivo tumor activity was assessed by xenograft study. RESULTS: HLJDT significantly increased the expression of inactivated phospho-Cdc2 and phospho-Cdc25C, and decreased the levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1, Cdc2, and Cdc25C, thereby contributing to cell-cycle arrest. HLJDT increased the expression of Bax and Bak, but decreased the level of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and subsequently triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In addition, HLJDT also inhibited cell-survival signaling by enhancing the amount of IkappaBalpha in the cytoplasm, reducing the level and activity of NF-kappaB in the nucleus, and subsequently attenuating the expression of Bcl-XL in Hep G2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells(.) The inhibitory effect mediated by HLJDT on cell growth was also demonstrated in a nude mouse model, in which the liver cancer cells induced tumor xenograft shrank considerably following treatment with HLJDT. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest a potential anticancer effect of HLJDT against human liver cancer cells.

26020238|a|Jaeumganghwa-tang (JGT, Zi-yin-jiang-huo-tang in Chinese and Jiin-koka-to in Japanese) is an oriental herbal formula that has long been used as a traditional medicine to treat respiratory and kidney diseases. Recent studies revealed that JGT exhibited potent inhibitory effects on allergies, inflammation, pain, convulsions, and prostate hyperplasia. Several constituent herbs in JGT induce apoptotic cancer cell death. However, the anti-cancer activity of JGT has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of JGT using highly tumorigenic HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In addition, we examined whether the Lactobacillus fermentation of JGT enhanced its anti-cancer activity using an in vivo xenograft model because fermentation of herbal extracts is thought to strengthen their therapeutic effects. Data revealed that JGT suppressed the growth of cancer cells efficiently by stimulating G1 cell cycle arrest and then inducing apoptotic cell death by causing mitochondrial damage and activating caspases. The phosphorylation of p38 and ERK also played a role in JGT-induced cell death. In vitro experiments demonstrated that JGT fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus, designated fJGT162, elicited similar patterns of cell death as did non-fermented JGT. Meanwhile, the daily oral administration of 120 mg/kg fJGT162 to HT1080-bearing BALB/c nude mice suppressed tumor growth dramatically (up to 90%) compared with saline treatment, whereas the administration of non-fermented JGT suppressed tumor growth by ~70%. Collectively, these results suggest that JGT and fJGT162 are safe and useful complementary and alternative anti-cancer herbal therapies, and that Lactobacillus fermentation improves the in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of JGT significantly.

18835123|t|Metabolic urinary profiling of alcohol hepatotoxicity and intervention effects of Yin Chen Hao Tang in rats using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
18835123|a|This paper was designed to study metabonomic characters of the hepatotoxicity induced by alcohol and the intervention effects of Yin Chen Hao Tang (YCHT), a classic traditional Chinese medicine formula for treatment of jaundice and liver disorders in China. Urinary samples from control, alcohol- and YCHT-treated rats were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS) in positive ionization mode. The total ion chromatograms obtained from the control, alcohol- and YCHT-treated rats were easily distinguishable using a multivariate statistical analysis method such as the principal components analysis (PCA). The greatest difference in metabolic profiling was observed from alcohol-treated rats compared with the control and YCHT-treated rats. The positive ions m/z 664.3126 (9.00 min) was elevated in urine of alcohol-treated rats, whereas, ions m/z 155.3547 (10.96 min) and 708.2932 (9.01 min) were at a lower concentration compared with that in urine of control rats, however, these ions did not indicate a statistical difference between control rats and YCHT-treated rats. The ion m/z 664.3126 was found to correspond to ceramide (d18:1/25:0), providing further support for an involvement of the sphingomyelin signaling pathway in alcohol hepatotoxicity and the intervention effects of YCHT.

35303581|t|Network pharmacology prediction and molecular docking-based strategy to explore the potential mechanism of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction against sepsis.
35303581|a|BACKGROUND: Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HLJDD) is a classical herbal formula with potential efficacy in the treatment of sepsis. However, the main components and potential mechanisms of HLJDD remain unclear. This study aims to initially clarify the potential mechanism of HLJDD in the treatment of sepsis based on network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques. METHODS: The principal components and corresponding protein targets of HLJDD were searched on TCMSP, BATMAN-TCM and ETCM and the compound-target network was constructed by Cytoscape3.8.2. Sepsis targets were searched on OMIM and DisGeNET databases. The intersection of compound target and disease target was obtained and the coincidence target was imported into STRING database to construct a PPI network. We further performed GO and KEGG enrichment analysis on the targets. Finally, molecular docking study was approved for the core target and the active compound. RESULTS: There are 257 nodes and 792 edges in the component target network. The compounds with a higher degree value are quercetin, kaempferol, and wogonin. The protein with a higher degree in the PPI network is JUN, RELA, TNF. GO and KEGG analysis showed that HLJDD treatment of sepsis mainly involves positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, negative regulation of apoptosis process, response to hypoxia and other biological processes. The signaling pathways mainly include PI3K-AKT, MAPK, TNF signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that quercetin, kaempferol and wogonin have higher affinity with JUN, RELA and TNF. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the active ingredients and potential molecular mechanism of HLJDD in the treatment of sepsis, and provides a reference for subsequent basic research.

33357767|t|Daily oral supplementation of Hochu-Ekki-To prevents osteoclastic activation and bone loss in ovariectomized mice.
33357767|a|Bone remodeling is sophisticatedly regulated by two different cell types: bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts. Hochu-Ekki-To, a Japanese traditional herbal medicine, is commonly used for the treatment of chronic diseases or frailty after an illness; however, its effects on metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis are not well known. We herein report that daily oral Hochu-Ekki-To administration significantly inhibits osteoclast activation as well as the reduction in bone volume in ovariectomized mice. Our results suggest that supplementation with Hochu-Ekki-To might be beneficial for the prophylaxis and treatment of metabolic bone diseases associated with abnormal osteoclast activation.

17980528|t|Antiinflammatory effects of Bu-zhong-yi-qi-tang in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis.
17980528|a|Bu-zhong-yi-qi-tang, an ancient formula of Chinese medicine usually used in the treatment of allergic diseases, was evaluated in the treatment of patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. In this study, 60 patients allergic to house dust mite allergen confirmed by skin test and MAST test were recruited and randomized. An experimental group of 36 patients was treated with Bu-zhong-yi-qi-tang, whereas a control group of 24 patients was treated with a non-effective formula Ping-wei-san for 3 months. The nasal symptomatic scores and the responses of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to IL-4-stimulation were measured after treatment. The nasal symptomatic scores in the experimental group were significantly improved (3.78+/-0.09 before treatment vs. 0.57+/-0.06 after treatment). In contrast, no change was found in symptomatic scores in the control group (3.17+/-0.12 before treatment vs. 2.79+/-0.14 after treatment). Moreover, total serum IgE and the IL-4-stimulated production of PGE(2) and LTC(4) by PMN was significantly suppressed in the experimental group after treatment compared to the control group. The COX-2 mRNA expression in IL-4-stimulated PMN was also significantly suppressed after Bu-zhong-yi-qi-tang treatment. These results suggest that Bu-zhong-yi-qi-tang but not Ping-wei-san was beneficial to the patients with perennial allergic rhinitis via suppressed nasal inflammation by an antiinflammatory effect.

25821478|t|Protective effects of tao-Hong-si-wu decoction on memory impairment and hippocampal damage in animal model of vascular dementia.
25821478|a|Tao-Hong-Si-Wu decoction (TSD) as a traditional chinese medicine (TCM) has been developed to treat thrombotic diseases for hundreds of years, and vascular dementia (VD) is a cognitive dysfunction syndrome caused by cerebral embolism. In this study, the protective effect of TSD on memory impairment and brain damage in rat model of VD induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was investigated. The study showed that rats in MCAO treatment with TSD for 14 days significantly improved behavioral function, increased densities of neuron, and induced angiogenesis in the brain compared with model rats. TSD also adjusted the neurotransmitter levels, reduced the content of endothelin-1 (ET-1), and induced the activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in hippocampus. Moreover, the immunohistochemical staining and western blotting results also revealed that TSD decreased apoptosis via upregulated B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) ratio. These results demonstrated TSD possesses neuroprotective and antidementia properties by preventing the loss of neural cells, adjusting brain neurotransmitter, promoting cerebral blood circulation, and decreasing apoptosis. These results suggested that TSD might be developed as an effective drug for the prevention of VD.

31011358|t|Anticonvulsant Effects of Dingxian Pill in Pentylenetetrazol-Kindled Rats.
31011358|a|Dingxian pill has been used as an antiepilepsy agent in China from ancient to modern times, of which the concrete pharmacological characterization and the underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. The present study was undertaken to investigate them by animal behavior, electroencephalogram (EEG), Morris water maze, immunohistochemistry, transcriptomics, and real-time PCR. In our results, the treatment of Dingxian pill dose-dependently inhibited PTZ-induced seizure-like behavior and reduced the seizure grades, LFP power spectral density, and brain wave of the epileptiform EEG component induced by PTZ. In Morris water maze tests, the learning and memory ability of kindled epileptic rats could be attenuated more efficiently by Dingxian pill. For the immediate early gene c-fos, the expression was reduced after Dingxian pill treatment, and the difference was significant between the treatment and the model group. Through the transcriptome analysis of the gene expression in hippocampus, Egr3, Nrg, Arc, and Ptgs2, closely related to epilepsy, had been proved to be downregulated by application of Dingxian pill. All of the results not only highlight the antiepileptic effects of Dingxian pill and its molecular mechanism, but also provide a modern validity theory for the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

23212569|t|Effects of Zuogui Pill () and Yougui Pill () on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A signaling transduction pathways of axonal regeneration in model rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
23212569|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Zuogui Pill (, ZGP) and Yougui Pill (, YGP) on the expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling of axonal regeneration in the Lewis rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), in order to explore the possible mechanism of ZGP and YGP on promoting axonal regeneration. METHODS: The rats were randomly divided into normal control (NC), model (MO), prednisone acetate (PA), ZGP and YGP groups. The EAE model of rat was established by injecting antigen containing myelin basic protein (MBP)68-86. The brain and spinal cord were harvested on the 14th and 28th day post-immunization (PI), the protein and mRNA expression of BDNF and PKA in the brain and spinal cord of rats were detected by Western blot analysis and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the cAMP levels were detected by using enzyme-immunoassay method. RESULTS: (1) On the 28th day PI, the mRNA expression of BDNF in brain white matter and spinal cord of rats in ZGP and YGP groups were up-regulated, especially in YGP group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). (2) On the 14th day PI, the cAMP levels in brain white matters significantly increased in PA and YGP groups compared with MO group (P<0.05 or P<0.01), and the cAMP level in YGP group was higher than that in ZGP group (P<0.05). The cAMP level in spinal cord also significantly increased in YGP group compared with MO, PA and ZGP groups, respectively (P<0.01). (3) On the 14th day PI, the PKA expression in spinal cord of rats in ZGP group was significantly decreased compared with MO and YGP groups, respectively (P<0.05). (4) On the 28th day PI, there was a positive correlation between cAMP and PKA expression in the brain white matter of YGP rats. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ZGP and YGP may promote axonal regeneration by modulating cAMP/PKA signal transduction pathway, but the targets of molecular mechanism of ZGP may be different from those of YGP.

33717259|t|Effect and related mechanism of Yinchenhao decoction on mice with lithogenic diet-induced cholelithiasis.
33717259|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects and the underlying mechanisms of Yinchenhao Decoction (YCHD), a traditional Chinese medicine formulation, on C57BL/6 mice with lithogenic diet (LD)-induced cholelithiasis. The condition of cholelithiasis was evaluated using a six-level criteria. Levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the serum and liver tissue were measured using enzyme colorimetry. Concentrations of TC, phospholipids (PL) and total bile acids (TBA) in the bile were measured to calculate the cholesterol saturation index. Liver histopathology was microscopically observed and mRNA expression levels of ABCG5, ABCG8, SRBI, ABCB4, ABCB11 and NPC1L1 involved in cholesterol metabolism were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The results showed that feeding mice the LD induced cholelithiasis, along with abnormal serum biochemical indices and imbalances in biliary cholesterol homeostasis. Increased ALT and ALP levels in the serum and ALT, ALP, TC and LDL-C levels in the serum and liver indicated the existence of hepatocyte injury, which were consistent with the pathological changes. YCHD treatment ameliorated the serum and hepatic biochemical abnormalities and adjusted the biliary imbalance. In addition, elevated expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 5/8, scavenger receptor class B type I and Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 in the liver and small intestine were observed at the onset of cholelithiasis but were reversed by YCHD. Taken together, results from the present study suggest that YCHD ameliorated LD-induced cholelithiasis mice, which may be caused by improvements in biliary cholesterol supersaturation and regulation of cholesterol metabolism.

34540098|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of Shenling Baizhu powder as an adjuvant therapy on the serum TH1 of elderly patients with ulcerative colitis complicated by bloody purulent stool. METHODS: A total of 70 elderly patients with ulcerative colitis complicated by bloody purulent stool presenting to our hospital from June 2018 to October 2019 were enrolled and equally randomized. Patients were administered mesalazine enteric-coated tablets in the control group, and patients were additionally treated with Shenling Baizhu powder. The main clinical symptom scores, the relief of bloody purulent stool symptoms, and the serum TH1 levels before and after treatment as well as the clinical efficacy were compared in the two groups, and the ROC curve was plotted to analyze the value of serum TH1 cytokine in predicting disease recurrence. RESULTS: After treatment, the scores in the two groups were decreased significantly, and the decrease in the study group was significant (P < 0.05). The total effective rate in the study group (88.57%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (68.57%), and the response rate after treatment in the study group (85.71%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (62.86%). In the two groups, serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels were decreased significantly before and after treatment, but the decrease in the study group was significant (P < 0.05). ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of IL-2 was 0.797, the maximum Jordan index was 0.573, the sensitivity was 61.10%, and the specificity was 96.20%. The AUC of IFN-gamma was 0.794, the maximum Jordan index was 0.453, the sensitivity was 55.60%, and the specificity was 72.50%. CONCLUSION: Shenling Baizhu powder as an adjuvant therapy is a promising option for elderly patients with ulcerative colitis complicated by bloody purulent stool.

26818584|t|Xuefu Zhuyu decoction, a traditional Chinese medicine, provides neuroprotection in a rat model of traumatic brain injury via an anti-inflammatory pathway.
26818584|a|Neuroinflammation is central to the pathology of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Xuefu Zhuyu decoction (XFZY) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine to treat TBI. To elucidate its potential molecular mechanism, this study aimed to demonstrate that XFZY functions as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to controlled cortical impact to produce a neuroinflammatory response. The treatment groups received XFZY (9 g/kg and 18 g/kg), Vehicle group and Sham group were gavaged with equal volumes of saline. The modified neurologic severity score (mNSS) and the Morris water maze test were used to assess neurological deficits. Arachidonic acid (AA) levels in brain tissue were measured using tandem gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in injured ipsilateral brain tissue were detected by ELISA. AKT and mTOR expression were measured by western blot analysis. The results indicated that XFZY significantly enhanced spatial memory acquisition. XFZY (especially at a dose of 9 g/kg) markedly reduced the mNSS and levels of AA, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Significant downregulation of AKT/mTOR/p70S6K proteins in brain tissues was observed after the administration of XFZY (especially at a dose of 9 g/kg). XFZY may be a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing inflammation in TBI.

24791524|t|[Regulatory mechanism of NF-kappaB signaling pathway on renal tissue inflammation in chronic kidney disease and interventional effect of traditional Chinese medicine].
24791524|a|In chronic kidney disease (CKD), inflammatory responses during the progression of renal tissue and tissue injury related causes its progression to end-state renal disease. Among them, nuclear factor (nuclear factor, NF)-kappaB signaling pathway by regulating the corresponding nuclear expression of target gene transcription, as well as affecting the synthesis of inflammatory mediators, induction of inflammation lead to kidney damage and renal fibrosis. Some single herbs and their extracts (such as Astragali Radix, Scutellariae Radix, Ginkgo Folium) and some traditional Chinese medicine (such as Danggui Buxue decoction, Qilian decoction) can reduce the inflammatory damage induced by renal tissue NF-kappaB signaling pathway and delay the progression of CKD.

7832080|t|[Clinical efficacy of sairei-to in various urinary tract diseases centering on fibrosis].
7832080|a|A joint multi-institution study was conducted on the efficacy of Sairei-to, centering on urinary tract fibrosis. The subjects consisted of 18 patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis (including 3 women), 77 patients with plastic induration of penis, 5 patients with sclerotic lipogranuloma (all men), and 67 patients with hemorrhagic cystitis (including 6 men). As a rule, Sairei-to was administered in monotherapy for periods of 4 weeks or longer. Efficacy was most pronounced in the patients with sclerotic lipogranuloma and plastic induration of penis, with overall improvement rates (percentage of patients with ratings of effective or better) of 80% in the former and 77.9% in the latter group. The overall improvement rate in the patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis was 61.1%. In the above diseases, there were numerous patients concurrently administered drugs such as antiinflammatory enzyme preparations and corticoid preparations, and the improvement rates were somewhat higher in these patients treated concurrently with other drugs. Outstanding efficacy was also seen in hemorrhagic cystitis. Dividing the patients into irradiation and non-irradiation groups, respective overall improvement rates of 77.8% and 82.8% were obtained, with the non-irradiation group showing a slightly higher rate. The non-irradiation group showed slightly higher improvement rates in the subjects treated concurrently with drugs such as antibacterial drug. Conversely, the irradiation group showed significantly superior rates for monotherapy. Side effects such as mild gastrointestinal disturbances were seen in only 13 of 167 patients (7.8%), and the utility of this drug in treatment of the above diseases should be held in high regard.

14971716|t|The effects of a herbal medicine (Mao-to) in patients with chronic hepatitis C after injection of IFN-beta.
14971716|a|We found that a herbal medicine (Mao-to) relieves the side effects of interferon (IFN)-beta and the combination therapy improves the biochemical response rate. However, the exact mechanism by which Mao-to is effective remains to be established. We conducted a controlled trial to clarify the effects of Mao-to. The study was carried out in 18 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and we examined subjective symptoms, body temperature and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-beta, IL-1receptor antagonist (ra), IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Each patient received 6 million units of IFN-beta intravenously. Mao-to was given orally just before, just after, and 1 hour after IFN administration. The control study was carried out 6 months after the combination therapy of Mao-to and IFN-beta. The scores for general malaise, arthralgia and discomfort were significantly lower in the combination group than in control group. Body temperature did not significantly differ between the two groups. Plasma IL-6 level and IL-1ra were significantly elevated in the combination group compared to control (P = 0.0057 and 0.0003, respectively). Mao-to did not affect plasma concentrations of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. We considered the increment of IL-1ra caused by Mao-to is to be one of the key factors involved in reducing the flu-like symptoms accompanying IFN-beta and improving the biochemical response rate.

29183322|t|Extracts of Zuo Jin Wan, a traditional Chinese medicine, phenocopies 5-HTR1D antagonist in attenuating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer cells.
29183322|a|BACKGROUND: In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Zuo Jin Wan (ZJW), a herbal formula of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), possessed anticancer properties. However, the underlying mechanism for the action of ZJW remains unclear. Various subtypes of 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HTR) have been shown to play a role in carcinogenesis and cancer metastasis. 5-HTR1D, among the subtypes, is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and tissues. The present study aimed at investigating effect of ZJW extracts on the biological function of CRC cells, the expression of 5-HTR1D, and molecules of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. METHODS: In this study, the effect of ZJW extracts on 5-HTR1D expression and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway were investigated and contrasted with GR127935 (GR), a known 5-HTR1D antagonist, using the CRC cell line SW403. The cells were respectively treated with GR127935 and different doses of ZJW extracts. Proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of SW403 cells were compared between ZJW and GR127935 treatments. The expression of 5-HTR1D and signaling molecules involved in the canonic Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: After ZJW extracts treatment and GR127935 treatment, G1 arrest in cell cycle of SW403 was increased. Cell apoptosis was pronounced, and cell migration and invasion were suppressed. SW403 cells showed a dose-dependently decreased expression of 5-HTR1D, meanwhile, beta-catenin level was significantly decreased in nucleus of cells cultured with GR127935. Treatment of ZJW extracts dose-dependently resulted in decreased 5-HTR1D and a concomitant reduction in the Wnt/beta-catenin signal transduction, an effect indistinguishable from GR127935 treatment. CONCLUSION: The anticancer activity of ZJW extracts may be partially achieved through attenuation of the 5-HTR1D-Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

29512368|t|Regulatory Effect of Xiaoqinglong Decoction on Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) Inflammation Promoter in Mice with Cold Asthma.
29512368|a|Allergic asthma is a complex and chronic inflammatory airway disease. The thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) signaling pathway plays an important role in asthma. Xiaoqinglong Decoction (XQL) is the first choice to treat cold asthma in clinical settings. In this study, the role of the TSLP pathway in the onset of asthma and the protective mechanism of XQL were investigated. A total of 50 female mice were randomly divided into the following groups: the blank group (A), the model group (B), the XQL group (C), the dexamethasone group (D), and the XQL + dexamethasone group (E). Asthma was induced with ovalbumin, and corresponding drug intervention was carried out for 7 days, after which serum and lung tissue end points were analyzed. Serum interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), and TSLP levels were higher in group B than in group A (p<0.05). However these levels were lower in group C and D than in group B (p<0.05), and there was no significant difference between groups C and D (p>0.05). Interestingly, these end points were significantly lower in group E than in groups C and D (p<0.05). Regarding pathologic changes, the inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs of groups C, D, and E was lower than that of group B, especially in group E. We conclude that the TSLP pathway plays an important role in the course of asthma, and can be used as an important target for asthma treatment; XQL may play a role in reducing inflammation and relieving asthma by regulating the TSLP signaling pathway.

28278436|t|The anti-sepsis activity of the components of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction with high lipid A-binding affinity.
28278436|a|Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HJD), one of the classic recipes for relieving toxicity and fever, is a common method for treating sepsis in China. However, the effective components of HJD have not yet been identified. This experiment was carried out to elucidate the effective components of HJD against sepsis. Thus, seven fractions from HJD were tested using a biosensor to test their affinity for lipid A. The components obtained that had high lipid A-binding fractions were further separated, and their affinities to lipid A were assessed with the aid of a biosensor. The levels of LPS in the blood were measured, and pathology experiments were conducted. The LPS levels and mRNA expression analysis of TNF-alpha and IL-6 of the cell supernatant and animal tissue were evaluated to investigate the molecular mechanisms. Palmatine showed the highest affinity to lipid A and was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results of the in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that the levels of LPS, TNF-alpha and IL-6 of the palmatine group were significantly lower than those of the sepsis model group (p<0.01). The group treated with palmatine showed strong neutralizing LPS activity in vivo. The palmatine group exhibited stronger protective activity on vital organs compared to the LPS-induced animal model. This verifies that HJD is a viable treatment option for sepsis given that there are multiple components in HJD that neutralize LPS, decrease the release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha induced by LPS, and protect vital organs.

34997010|t|Integrated bioinformatics and network pharmacology to identify the therapeutic target and molecular mechanisms of Huangqin decoction on ulcerative Colitis.
34997010|a|Huangqin decoction (HQD) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine formula for ulcerative colitis. However, the pharmacology and molecular mechanism of HQD on ulcerative colitis is still unclear. Combined microarray analysis, network pharmacology, and molecular docking for revealing the therapeutic targets and molecular mechanism of HQD against ulcerative colitis. TCMSP, DrugBank, Swiss Target Prediction were utilized to search the active components and effective targets of HQD. Ulcerative colitis effective targets were obtained by microarray data from the GEO database (GSE107499). Co-targets between HQD and ulcerative colitis are obtained by Draw Venn Diagram. PPI (Protein-protein interaction) network was constructed by the STRING database. To obtain the core target, topological analysis is exploited by Cytoscape 3.7.2. GO and KEGG enrichment pathway analysis was performed to Metascape platform, and molecular docking through Autodock Vina 1.1.2 finished. 161 active components with 486 effective targets of HQD were screened. 1542 ulcerative colitis effective targets were obtained with |Log2FC|> 1 and adjusted P-value < 0.05. The Venn analysis was contained 79 co-targets. Enrichment analysis showed that HQD played a role in TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, etc. IL6, TNF, IL1B, PTGS2, ESR1, and PPARG with the highest degree from PPI network were successfully docked with 19 core components of HQD, respectively. According to ZINC15 database, quercetin (ZINC4175638), baicalein (ZINC3871633), and wogonin (ZINC899093) recognized as key compounds of HQD on ulcerative colitis. PTGS2, ESR1, and PPARG are potential therapeutic targets of HQD. HQD can act on multiple targets through multi-pathway, to carry out its therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis.

15553845|a|This study was designed to evaluate the effect of Bazhen decoction on bone marrow depression induced by cyclophosphamide (CY) in mice. An experimental model of mouse bone marrow injury was established through cyclophosphamide induced and the following phenomena were observed. The techniques of culture of hematopoietic progenitor cell and hematopoietic growth factor assay were used. Bazhen decoction could obviously promote the proliferation of bone marrow cells of anaemic mice. The culture media of spleen cell, macrophage, lung and skeletal muscle treated with Bazhen decoction had much stronger stimulating effects on hematopoietic cells. The bone marrow cells of the anaemic mice could yield TNF through Bazhen decoction treatment. It was suggested that Bazhen decoction is clinically a hopeful drug used to cure bone marrow depression and attenuate the side effects of CY.

27161221|t|HuangQi Decoction Ameliorates Renal Fibrosis via TGF-beta/Smad Signaling Pathway In Vivo and In Vitro.
27161221|a|OBJECTIVE: Traditional Chinese Medicine compound HuangQi decoction is widely used in clinical treatment of chronic kidney disease, but its role on renal interstitial fibrosis and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of HuangQi decoction on renal interstitial fibrosis and its association with the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway Methods: A total of 120 C57/BL mice were randomly divided into six groups: sham group, sham plus high-dose HuangQi decoction (1.08g/kg) group, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model group, and UUO model plus low to high doses of HuangQi decoction (0.12g/kg, 0.36g/kg and 1.08g/kg respectively) groups. Animals were sacrificed 14 days after the administration and ipsilateral kidney tissue was sampled for pathologic examinations. Immunohistochemistry, PCR and western blot were used to detect the expressions of related molecules in the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. TGF-beta1 was used in in vitro experiments to induce human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (HK2). RESULTS: HuangQi decoction improved ipsilateral kidney fibrosis in UUO mice and downregulated the expressions of TGF-beta1, TbetaRI, TbetaRII, Smad4, Smad2/3, P-Smad2/3, alpha-SMA, collagen type I, III and IV in a dose-dependent manner while upregulated the expression of Smad7 in the same fashion. Similar results were found in in vitro studies. CONCLUSION: The protective effect of HuangQi decoction for unilateral ureteral obstruction kidney damage in mice was mediated by downregulating the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway.

17432674|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Danzhi Xiaoyao Powder (DXP) on neuro-immuno-endocrine system in patients with depression. METHODS: A randomized double-blinded and controlled study was conducted in 63 cases of depression. They were assigned to the DXP group (32 cases, treated with DXP) and the control group (31 cases, treated with maprotiline). The curative effect was evaluated with Hamilton's depressive scale (HAMD) before and at the end of the 2nd, 4th and 6th week of the treatment. Serum levels of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cortisol (CORT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were detected before and at the 6th week of the treatment. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, the total score of HAMD decreased remarkably in both groups (P < 0.01), and the total score, as well as the scores of the three factors, i. e. anxiety/somatization, cognitive impairment and feeling of despair, were lower in the DXP group than that in the control group respectively (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). After 4 and 6 weeks of treatment the total score and score of the three factors all reduced significantly in both groups (P < 0.01), with insignificant difference between the groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, the serum levels of 5-HT and BDNF increased (P < 0.01), and the serum IL-6 level decreased in both groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), the serum CORT level reduced in the DXP group (P < 0.01), while the serum NE level elevated in the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: DXP is effective in improving symptoms of depression by regulating the levels of 5-HT, BDNF, CORT and IL-6.

26902832|t|A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a traditional herbal formula, Yukmijihwang-tang in elderly subjects with xerostomia.
26902832|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Yukmijihwang-tang (YMJ) is a typical herbal formula to treat Yin-deficiency (YD) syndrome by enriching the fluid-humor of the body. YMJ has been used to treat dry mouth symptoms for hundreds of years in traditional East Asian medicine. Xerostomia, a subjective oral dryness, is common in the elderly and results in impaired quality of life. Many conventional treatments for xerostomia provide only temporary symptom relief, and have side effects. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of YMJ for the treatment of xerostomia in the elderly. METHODS: This study was designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, two center trial. Ninety-six subjects aged 60-80 years who had experienced xerostomia for at least 3 months and presented with score>40 on the visual analog scale (VAS) for subjective oral dryness were recruited and randomly allocated to YMJ and placebo groups. YMJ or placebo was administered to each group for 8 weeks (3g of YMJ or placebo, three times per day). The primary outcome was change of VAS for xerostomia from 0 to 8 weeks. RESULTS: VAS for xerostomia was decreased by 22.04+/-22.76 in the YMJ group and 23.58+/-23.04 in the placebo group. YMJ had no effect on xerostomia. However, participants with BMIs lower than 29.37kg/m(2) showed improvement of xerostomia after 8 weeks of treatment with YMJ compared to placebo. In addition, YMJ improved oral moisture, which is associated with subjective oral dryness in the YMJ group, and the relationship between VAS for xerostomia and YD was significant. CONCLUSION: A trend was observed in which YMJ improved oral moisture status and subjective oral dryness in elderly subjects with lower BMI and greater tendency toward YD.

28028720|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanism of Liuwei Dihuang Pill (, LDP) in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) with Shen (Kidney) yin deficiency. METHODS: In this study, 205 cases of PMOP were divided into the PMOP Shen-yin deficiency group (Group A), PMOP Shen-yang deficiency group (Group B), PMOP without Shen deficiency group (Group C), and control group (Group N). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot techniques were used to observe the effects of LDP treatment on the cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1), ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 1 (ASB1), and prokineticin 2 (PROK2) genes and the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. RESULTS: The mRNA (P<0.05) and protein (P<0.01) expression levels of the CLCF1 gene in Group A were significantly lower than the corresponding levels in Group N. After LDP treatment for 3 months, the mRNA expression levels of the CLCF1 gene were obviously up-regulated (P<0.01). After 6-month treatment, the expression levels of CLCF1 mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated (both P<0.01), and the average bone density of the top femur had significantly increased (P<0.05). In vitro, CLCF1 overexpression resulted in a significant increase in the total protein and phosphorylated protein levels of JAK2 and STAT3. CONCLUSIONS: The CLCF1 gene is an important gene associated with PMOP Shen-yin deficiency and the therapeutic effects of LDP may be mediated by up-regulation of CLCF1 gene expression and activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.

9364288|a|On the basis of recent reports that keigai-rengyo-to (TJ-50), an oral Japanese Kampo (herb) medicine, is clinically effective in treating acne, and that tetracyclines are effective against acne by acting directly as an antioxidant on infiltrated neutrophils, we investigated the effect of TJ-50 on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), using human neutrophils and a cell-free, xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. The species investigated were superoxide radical anion (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (OH.). In addition, neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis and calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i in neutrophils were also assessed. TJ-50 significantly decreased neutrophil-generated O2-, H2O2 and OH. in a dose-dependent manner. Three kinds of ROS generated in the cell-free system were also reduced in the presence of TJ-50. On the other hand, the medicine did not markedly affect neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis or [Ca2+]i in neutrophils. Our results indicate that the clinical effectiveness of TJ-50 in the treatment of acne may be due partly to its antioxidant action on infiltrated neutrophils.

This suppressive effect was caused by the major component of Sairei-to, Syo-saiko-to but not by another component, Gorel-san. The suppressive effect of Syo-saiko-to was identified in its components (Bupleuri radix, Pinelliae tuber and Zingiberis rhizoma), but not in the other combined components (Ginseng radix and Zizyphi fructus). Further study revealed that the suppressive effects of the combined components were mainly derived from Bupleuri radix. It was demonstrated that the actual active ingredient is probably Saikosaponin-d. Light microscopy revealed that Sairei-to and its effective components suppressed the proliferation of mesangial cells and mesangial matrix expansion. Semiquantitative morphological studies of glomerular lesions on the eighth day showed that Syo-saiko-to and its combined components (Bupleuri radix, Zingiberis rhizoma and Pinelliae tuber) suppressed mesangial matrix expansion significantly compared with phosphate-buffered saline control groups (matrix score: 28.0 +/- 19.1 vs 102.3 +/- 14.1; 30.9 +/- 30.1 vs 102.3 +/- 14.1, P < 0.005, respectively). It was concluded that Saikosaponin-d, as well as Bupleuri radix, Syo-saiko-to and Sairei-to can suppress proteinuria and morphological changes in the rat glomerulonephritis model induced by mAb 1-22-3.

29247342|t|Effects of Banxia Xiexin Decoction () on Cisplatin-Induced Apoptosis of Human A549 Lung Cancer Cells.
29247342|a|OBJECTIVE: To examinie the synergistic effects of Banxia Xiexin Decoction (, Known as Banhasasim-tang in Korean) extract (BXDE) on cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in the A549 human lung cancer cell lines. METHODS: A549 cells were treated with varying concentrations (50-200 mug/mL) of cisplatin and BXDE alone or in combination for 96 h. We used 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan assay and flow cytometry to analyze cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. RESULTS: The exposure of cells to cisplatin and BXDE alone or in combination decreased cell viability dose- and time-dependently (P<0.05), which was found to be mediated by the apoptotic pathway as confirmed by the increase in the annexin V(+)/propidium iodide- stained cell population and a ladder pattern of discontinuous DNA fragments. Furthermore, the apoptosis was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe) fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-FMK). CONCLUSIONS: BXDE significantly potentiated apoptotic effects of cisplatin in A549 cells. Moreover, apoptosis induced by BXDE might be the pivotal mechanism mediating its chemopreventative action against cancer.

10354822|a|The anticonvulsant effects of Shitei-To and its components on maximal electroshock seizures and chemical convulsions were examined. Shitei-To significantly prolonged the latency to bicuculline (2.0 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced clonic convulsions. Repeated treatment with Shitei-To also significantly prolonged the latency to strychnine (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.)- and pentylenetetrazol (90 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced clonic convulsions. On the other hand, Shitei-To had no effect on maximal electroshock seizures. Of the components of Shitei-To, Shitei had almost the same effect as Shitei-To against the clonic convulsions induced by the three chemical agents tested. These findings suggest that Shitei-To has anticonvulsant effects.

19568710|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic efficacy of Danggui Buxue Decoction No.1 in treating patients of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at the peri-operational stage and its impact on the patients' immune function. METHODS: Eighty-two NSCLC patients were randomly assigned to two groups equally, the control group and the test group, they were given conventional treatment, while to the test group, DB1 were given additionally. The observation was conducted by testing the changes of T-lymphocyte subsets, natural killer (NK) cell activity, serum levels of immunoglobulin (IgA, IgM, IgG), interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), cytokeratin fragment 19 (CYFRA21-1) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in NSCLC patients before and after administration of DB1, and analyzing the patients' general condition. RESULTS: The level of CD3(+), CD4(+), the ratio of CD4 and CD8(+), IgA, IgM, IgG and IL-2 decreased in patients with NSCLC on day 1 after operation, and the level of CD8 and TNF-alpha increased compared to pre-operation. While the levels of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD4 /CD8(+), NK cell activity, serum IgA, IgM, IgG, IL-2 began to elevate, CD8 and TNF-alpha levels began to decline in patients administered with DB1 on day 3 after the operation, earlier than patients who did not use the decoction. The level of CYFRA21-1 and CEA, was immediately decreased after operation in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Applying DB1 to NSCLC patients at an early post-operational stage could alleviate the impairment and accelerate the recovery of immune function of patients to enhance their immunity. DB1 also shows an anti-tumor action to a certain degree.

34125845|t|Network pharmacology and molecular docking study on the mechanism of colorectal cancer treatment using Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang.
34125845|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We aimed to predict the targets and signal pathways of Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang (XCHT) in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on network pharmacology, just as well as to further analyze its anti-CRC material basis and mechanism of action. METHODS: We adopted Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrated Database (TCMID) databases to screen the active ingredients and potential targets of XCHT. CRC-related targets were retrieved by analyzing published microarray data (accession number GSE110224) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The common targets were used to construct the "herb-active ingredient-target" network using the Cytoscape 3.8.0 software. Next, we constructed and analyzed protein-to-protein interaction (PPI) using BisoGenet and CytoNCA plug-in in Cytoscape. We then performed Gene Ontology (GO) functional and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of target genes using the R package of clusterProfiler. Furthermore, we used the AutoDock Tools software to conduct molecular docking studies on the active ingredients and key targets to verify the network pharmacological analysis results. RESULTS: We identified a total of 71 active XCHT ingredients and 20 potential anti-CRC targets. The network analysis revealed quercetin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, baicalein, and acacetin as potential key compounds, and PTGS2, NR3C2, CA2, and MMP1 as potential key targets. The active ingredients of XCHT interacted with most CRC disease targets. We showed that XCHT's therapeutic effect was attributed to its synergistic action (multi-compound, multi-target, and multi-pathway). Our GO enrichment analysis showed 46 GO entries, including 20 biological processes, 6 cellular components, and 20 molecular functions. We identified 11 KEGG signaling pathways, including the IL-17, TNF, Toll-like receptor, and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Our results showed that XCHT could play a role in CRC treatment by regulating different signaling pathways. The molecular docking experiment confirmed the correlation between five core compounds (quercetin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, baicalein, and acacetin) just as well as PTGS2, NR3C2, CA2, and MMP1. CONCLUSION: In this study, we described the potential active ingredients, possible targets, and key biological pathways responsible for the efficacy of XCHT in CRC treatment, providing a theoretical basis for further research.

35462892|t|Network Pharmacology Analysis of Huangqi Jianzhong Tang Targets in Gastric Cancer.
35462892|a|Background: The Chinese medicine, Huangqi Jianzhong Tang (HJT), is widely used to treat gastric cancer (GC). In this study, network pharmacological methods were used to analyze the potential therapeutic targets and pharmacological mechanisms of HJT in GC. Methods: Bioactive components and targets of HJT and GC-related targets were identified using public databases. The protein-protein interaction network of potential targets of HJT in GC was constructed using the Cytoscape plug-in (v3.8.0), CytoHubba. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed, in addition to molecular docking and animal experiments to verify the results of network pharmacology analysis. Results: A total of 538 GC-related targets were identified. The bioactive components of HJT were selected for drug-likeness evaluation and binomial statistical model screening, which revealed 63 bioactive components and 72 targets. Based on GO enrichment analysis, all targets in the protein-protein interaction network were mainly involved in the response to oxidative stress and neuronal death. Further, KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that the treatment of GC with HJT mainly involved the Wnt signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway, thereby providing insights into the mechanism of the effects of HJT on GC. Conclusion: This study revealed the potential bioactive components and molecular mechanisms of HJT, which may be useful for the treatment of GC, and provided insights into the development of new drugs for GC.

28073341|a|BACKGROUND: SijunziDecoction (SJZD) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription used to treat the diseases of gastrointestinal tract since ancient times. The objective of this study was to investigate the protective effects of SJZD on TNBS-induced colitis in rats and TNBS-damaged Caco2 cells. METHODS: The rat colitis model was induced by 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). SJZD (2.8 5.6, 11.2 g/kg) or salazosulfapyridine (SASP) (0.4 g/kg) was administrated orally in rats for 7 days. DAI, pathological scores and the expression of claudin-2 were evaluated. Then we explored the effect and mechanism of SijunziDecoction Serum (SJZDS) onTNBS-damaged Caco2 cells to figure out intestinal barrier protective effect and mechanism of SJZD. RESULTS: SJZD significantly ameliorated the severity of TNBS-induced colitis and downregulated the level of claudin-2 in colonic tissues. SJZDS promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis ofTNBS-damaged Caco2 cells. In Caco2 cell monolayers, we provided mechanistic evidence that SJZDS-induced increased TEER and decreased permeability after TNBS damage, which were mediated through claudin-2 and NF-kappaB pathway, including the upregulation of claudin-2, decreased activity of NF-kappaB p65, reduced level of NF-kappaB p65 and MLCK. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that SJZD possesses protective effect of intestinal barrier towards TNBS-induced colitis in rats and TNBS-damaged Caco2 cells in vitro. SJZDis a potential protective agent of intestinal barrier that deserves further investigation.

26927371|t|[Pulsatilla decoction inhibits vulvovaginal Candida albicans proliferation and reduces inflammatory cytokine levels in vulvovaginal candidiasis mice].
26927371|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the possible regulatory effect of Pulsatilla decoction on Th17 cells and inflammatory cytokines of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) mice. METHODS: Seventy-two female Kunming mice were randomly assigned into six groups: a blank control group, a VVC model group, a fluconazole group and three Pulsatilla decoction groups (dose levels: 22.5, 15.0 and 7.5 g/kg, respectively). The VVC mouse models were established by vaginal inoculation with Candida albicans (C. albicans) in female mice in pseudoestrus state caused by estradiol injection. After 7-day treatment on VVC mice, the vaginal C. albicans burden was assessed using dilution spread plate method; the vaginal C. albicans morphology was observed by Gram staining method; the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-17, IL-21 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in sera were detected by ELISA. The content of the transcription factor retinoid related orphan receptor gamma t (RORgammat) in vaginal tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The VVC mouse models were successfully developed. After treatment, the vaginal C. albicans burden of the fluconazole group and 22.5 g/kg Pulsatilla decoction group dropped significantly compared with that of the VVC model group. Gram staining showed that the VVC mice had lots of C. albicans hyphae in vaginal discharge, that 7.5 g/kg Pulsatilla decoction group remained the mycelia-phase C. albicans, and that 15.0 g/kg Pulsatilla decoction group had the majority of yeast-phase C. albicans and a few of mycelia-phase, while no hyphae and only very few of yeast-phase C. albicans were observed in 22.5 g/kg Pulsatilla decoction group and fluconazole group. After 7-day treatment, compared with the model group, the levels of IL-6, IL- 17, IL-21 and TNF-alpha in the sera of the fluconazole group, 15.0 and 22.5 g/kg Pulsatilla decoction groups were reduced significantly and the levels of RORgammat in the vaginal tissues of the fluconazole group, 15.0 and 22.5 g/kg Pulsatilla decoction groups also decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: Pulsatilla decoction could inhibit the proliferation of vulvovaginal C. albicans and reduces the levels of inflammatory cytokines in VVC mice.

23983789|t|Microarray analysis reveals the molecular basis of antiarthritic activity of huo-luo-xiao-ling dan.
23983789|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of autoimmune origin. Huo-luo-xiao-ling dan (HLXL) is an herbal mixture that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine over several decades to treat chronic inflammatory diseases including RA. However, the mechanism of the anti-arthritic action of this herbal remedy is poorly understood at the molecular level. In this study, we determined by microarray analysis the effects of HLXL on the global gene expression profile of the draining lymph node cells (LNC) in the rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) model of human RA. In LNC restimulated in vitro with the disease-related antigen mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 (Bhsp65), 84 differentially expressed genes (DEG) (64 upregulated and 20 downregulated) versus 120 DEG (94 upregulated and 26 downregulated) were identified in HLXL-treated versus vehicle (Water)-treated rats, respectively, and 62 DEG (45 upregulated and 17 downregulated) were shared between the two groups. The most affected pathways in response to HLXL treatment included immune response, inflammation, cellular proliferation and apoptosis, and metabolic processes, many of which are directly relevant to arthritis pathogenesis. These results would advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the anti-arthritic activity of HLXL.

9568542|t|In vitro effects of sho-saiko-to on production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor by mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis C.
9568542|a|During the past 2 years, drug-induced interstitial pneumonia was reported in 66 Japanese patients, mainly among chronic hepatitis C patients, undergoing treatment with the Japanese herbal medicine "Sho-saiko-to" (TJ-9). As interstitial pneumonia is also induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), we examined the effects of TJ-9 on G-CSF production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In patients with hepatitis B or C, G-CSF production in the absence of any stimulation was significantly lower than healthy controls (p < 0.01). G-CSF production increased along with the increase of TJ-9 levels, and this could induce excessive production of G-CSF in hepatitis C patients, and this may be a cause of interstitial pneumonia.

7623003|t|Efficacy of kakkon-to, a traditional herb medicine, in herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in mice.
7623003|a|Kakkon-to is one of the representative traditional herb medicines (Kampo formulae) and has been used historically for the treatment of infectious diseases in China and Japan. The efficacy of this preparation was characterised using a cutaneous herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in mice as a model for human viral infection. Kakkon-to at a dose corresponding to human use reduced significantly the mortality of HSV-1-infected mice and localised skin lesions. Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to HSV-1 antigen was significantly stronger in treated mice than in untreated mice. However, no histopathological difference was noted in the skin lesions between treated and untreated mice except for the size of the lesions. Kakkon-to did not inhibit the growth of HSV-1 in vitro. Natural killer cell activity, natural cytotoxic killer cell activity, and the population of T-cell subsets in spleen cells of infected mice were not affected by the drug. Kakkon-to did not augment interferon induction and anti-HSV-1 antibody production, nor increased cytokine levels such as interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in sera of infected mice. Thus, Kakkon-to induced strong DTH to HSV-1 in infected mice, which may have caused localisation of skin lesions and reduction in the mortality of treated mice.

30510632|t|Formulated Chinese Medicine Shaoyao Gancao Tang Reduces Tau Aggregation and Exerts Neuroprotection through Anti-Oxidation and Anti-Inflammation.
30510632|a|Misfolded tau proteins induce accumulation of free radicals and promote neuroinflammation by activating microglia-releasing proinflammatory cytokines, leading to neuronal cell death. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have been widely used in clinical practice to treat neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. This study examined the neuroprotection effects of formulated CHMs Bai-Shao (made of Paeonia lactiflora), Gan-Cao (made of Glycyrrhiza uralensis), and Shaoyao Gancao Tang (SG-Tang, made of P. lactiflora and G. uralensis at 1 : 1 ratio) in cell model of tauopathy. Our results showed that SG-Tang displayed a greater antioxidative and antiaggregation effect than Bai-Shao and Gan-Cao and a stronger anti-inflammatory activity than Bai-Shao but similar to Gan-Cao. In inducible 293/SH-SY5Y cells expressing proaggregant human tau repeat domain (DeltaK280 tauRD), SG-Tang reduced tau misfolding and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in DeltaK280 tauRD 293 cells and promoted neurite outgrowth in DeltaK280 tauRD SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, SG-Tang displayed anti-inflammatory effects by reducing nitric oxide (NO) production in mouse BV-2 microglia and increased cell viability of DeltaK280 tauRD-expressing SH-SY5Y cells inflamed by BV-2 conditioned medium. To uncover the neuroprotective mechanisms of SG-Tang, apoptosis protein array analysis of inflamed tau expressing SH-SY5Y cells was conducted and the suppression of proapoptotic proteins was confirmed. In conclusion, SG-Tang displays neuroprotection by exerting antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities to suppress neuronal apoptosis in human tau cell models. The study results lay the base for future applications of SG-Tang on tau animal models to validate its effect of reducing tau misfolding and potential disease modification.

25803610|t|Combination of active components of Xiexin decoction ameliorates renal fibrosis through the inhibition of NF-kappaB and TGF-beta1/Smad pathways in db/db diabetic mice.
25803610|a|Xiexin decoction, a herbal therapeutic agent commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, is recognized for its beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathy exerted through the combined action of multiple components, including Rhizoma Coptidis alkaloids (A), Radix et Rhizoma Rhei polysaccharides (P), and Radix Scutellaria flavones (F). Our previous studies have shown that a combination of A, P, and F (APF) exhibits renoprotective effects against diabetic nephropathy. This study was aimed at determining the effects of APF on renal fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy and elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms. To evaluate the effects of APF, in vivo, db/db diabetic mice were orally administered a low or high dose of APF (300 or 600 mg/kg, respectively) once a day for 8 weeks. We evaluated the blood and urine indices of metabolic and renal function, renal tissue histopathology, renal inflammation, and fibrosis. APF treatment significantly ameliorated glucose and lipid metabolism dysfunction, decreased urinary albumin excretion, normalized creatinine clearance, and reduced the morphological changes in renal tissue. Additionally, APF administration in db/db diabetic mice reduced the elevated levels of renal inflammation mediators such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and active nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). APF treatment also reduced type I and IV collagen, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and TGF-beta1 type II receptor expression levels, and decreased the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in the kidneys of db/db diabetic mice. These results suggest that APF reduces renal fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy through the NF-kappaB and TGF-beta1/Smad signaling pathways. In vitro, APF treatment reduced cell proliferation and protein expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen I, TGF-beta1 and NF-kappaB in mesangial cells cultured with high glucose concentrations. Our findings indicate that treatment with multi-component herbal therapeutic formulations may be a useful approach for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

9879411|t|The herbal medicine shoseiryu-to inhibits allergen-induced synthesis of tumour necrosis factor alpha by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis.
9879411|a|The herbal medicine shoseiryu-to is an effective agent in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. However, the mechanism by which it exerts its action in improving patient symptoms remains unclear. It might affect the allergen-induced TH1 and/or TH2 responses. This study investigated whether the herbal medicine could affect cytokine synthesis by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in response to the major Dermatophagoides farinae (D. farinae) allergen, Der f 1. PBMCs were obtained from 15 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis due to D. farinae, and were stimulated for 96 h with 10 micrograms/ml Der f 1 in the presence or absence of 45 mg/ml shoseiryu-to. The culture supernatants were harvested to determine the synthesis of IgE, interleukin 5 (IL-5), IL-6, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). The agent did not affect the allergen-induced synthesis of IL-5, IL-6 and IFN-gamma, but somewhat decreased the synthesis of IgE and IL-10. This study highlighted an interesting pharmacological action of shoseiryu-to to substantially inhibit the allergen-induced synthesis of TNF-alpha. Our study suggests that the shoseiryu-to may alleviate nasal symptoms in allergic rhinitis through control of the allergen-induced inflammatory process.

7108310|a|Eight infertile hyperandrogenic and oligomenorrheic women were investigated for lowering serum testosterone levels and inducing regular ovulation by Shakuyaku-Kanzo-To (mixed extracts of Paeonae Radix and Glycyrrhizae Radix). Serum testosterone levels (50-160 ng/dl) were lowered to less than 50 ng/dl in 7 patients by Shakuyaku-Kanzo-To 5-10 g daily administered for 2-8 weeks. Six of 7 patients ovulated regularly and 2 of 6 patients conceived. Serum LH levels, which were shown to be above 30 mIU/ml in 7 patients were lowered to less than 30 mIU/ml in 5 patients by dexamethasone 1 mg daily administered for 6.5 days. All of these patients ovulated regularly by Shakuyaku-Kanzo-To. No side effects were observed. Thus, Shakuyaku-Kanzo-To is indicated for lowering serum testosterone levels and inducing regular ovulation and pregnancy in infertile hyperandrogenic patients, especially in the patients whose serum LH levels were shown to be lowered to less than 30 mIU/ml by dexamethasone.

33645093|a|To explore the action mechanism of Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction in treating myocardial infarction based on network pharmaco-logy and molecular docking. Active components and corresponding targets of Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction were obtained through Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database(TCMSP), and related targets of myocardial infarction were obtained through GeneCards, DisGeNET, and OMIM databases. Then the intersection targets were obtained by integrating the drug targets and disease targets. The "active component-target" network was constructed by Cytoscape software, and protein-protein interaction(PPI) network was drawn using STRING platform. Protein cluster analysis was carried out using MCODE. GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were carried out using DAVID database and ClueGO, and molecular docking was carried out using Autodock Vina and Pymol. Finally, 226 active components of Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction were obtained, 257 corresponding targets, 1 340 targets of myocardial infarction, and 109 drug and disease intersection targets were obtained. From GO enrichment analysis, 208 biological process terms, 38 molecular function terms, and 33 cellular component terms were obtained. From KEGG pathway analysis, NF-kappaB signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and other related pathways were obtained. The molecular docking results showed that the main active components(quercetin, kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, luteolin, stigmasterol and baicalein) of Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction in the treatment of myocardial infarction had good binding properties with the core proteins IL6, ALB, VEGFA, TNF, MAPK3 and CASP3. The results suggested that Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction may play a role in the treatment of myocardial infarction by reducing the inflammatory response, reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting cell apoptosis, and promoting angiogenesis.

17609919|a|Patients with digestive malignant tumor always have their immune function, especially the cellular immunity, suppressed to a certain extent. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) holds that Pi-Wei is the essence of postnatal life, and the genesis and development of digestive tumor are chiefly due to the insufficiency of vital-qi, which makes the body open to the invasion of evil pathogens. Starting from regulating the immune function of organisms, researchers recently obtained some therapeutic effects by applying the Chinese recipe, Sijunzi Decoction, in the treatment of digestive malignant tumors. In this paper, the related studies on the concerned basic theory and clinical application were reviewed.

32038240|t|Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Huangqin Decoction on Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Mice Through Regulation of the Gut Microbiota and Suppression of the Ras-PI3K-Akt-HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB Pathways.
32038240|a|OBJECTIVE: Huangqin decoction (HQD), a classical traditional Chinese medicinal formula, has been commonly used to treat gastrointestinal diseases for thousands of years. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of HQD on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Experimental mice were given 3% DSS, and HQD (2.275, 4.55, and 9.1 g/kg), or mesalazine (ME, 200 mg/kg) orally for 7 days. Body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histology, and levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured to evaluate the effects of HQD on colitis. The effects of HQD on the Ras-phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways were evaluated by Western blot analysis. In addition, the gut microbiota was characterized using high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing. RESULTS: The results showed that HQD significantly reduced the body weight loss, ameliorated DAI, restored colon length, and improved the intestinal epithelial cell barrier in mice with DSS-induced colitis. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of inflammatory mediators were decreased following HQD treatment. Furthermore, the Ras-PI3K-Akt-HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB pathways were significantly inhibited by HQD. Finally, treatment with HQD resulted in recovery of gut microbiota diversity. CONCLUSIONS: HQD ameliorates DSS-induced colitis through regulation of the gut microbiota, and suppression of Ras-PI3K-Akt-HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB pathways. Our results suggested that HQD may be a potential candidate for treatment of UC.

32464544|t|Network Pharmacology and Bioactive Equivalence Assessment Integrated Strategy Driven Q-markers Discovery for Da-Cheng-Qi Decoction to Attenuate Intestinal Obstruction.
32464544|a|BACKGROUND: Intestinal obstruction (IO) is a kind of acute abdomen with high morbidity and mortality. Patients suffer from poor quality of life and tremendous financial pressure. Da-Cheng-Qi decoction (DCQD), a classical purgation prescription, has clinically been proven to be an effective treatment for IO. PURPOSE: Network pharmacology integrated with bioactive equivalence assessment was used to discover the quality marker (Q-marker) of DCQD against IO. METHODS: As there is hardly any targets recorded in database, thus the collection of IO targets was conducted by searching those of alternative diseases which have similar pathological symptoms with IO. In order to improve the reliability of the obtained targets, IO metabolomics data was introduced. Active compounds combination (ACC) was focused as potential Q-markers via component-target network analysis and function query from the identified components corresponding to the common targets. Bioequivalence between ACC and DCQD was assessed from the aspects of intestine motility (somatostatin secretion), inflammation (IL-6 secretion) and injury (wound healing assay) in vitro and was further validated in ileus rat model. PPI network analysis of core targets followed by gene pedigree classification and experimental validation confirmed the potential intervention pathway. RESULTS: A combination of 11 ingredients, including emodin, physcion, aloe-emodin, rhein, chrysophanol, gallic acid, magnolol, honokiol, naringenin, tangeretin, and nobiletin was finally confirmed bioequivalence with DQCD to some extent and could serve as Q-markers for DCQD to attenuate IO. PI3K/AKT was verified as a possible affected pathway that DCQD exerted the effectiveness against IO. CONCLUSION: For the disease with few recorded targets, searching those of alternative diseases which have similar pathological symptoms could be a feasible and effective approach. The proposed network pharmacology integrated bioactive equivalence evaluation paradigm is efficient to discover Q-marker of herbal formulae.

26819622|t|Huangqi Jianzhong Tang for Treatment of Chronic Gastritis: A Systematic Review of Randomized Clinical Trials.
26819622|a|To assess the clinical effects and safety of Huangqi Jianzhong Tang (HQJZ) for the treatment of chronic gastritis (CG), three English databases and four Chinese databases were searched through the inception to January 2015. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HQJZ with placebo, no intervention and western medicine were included. A total of 9 RCTs involving 979 participants were identified. The methodological quality of the included trials was generally poor. Meta-analyses demonstrated that HQJZ plus conventional medicine was more effective in improving overall gastroscopy outcome than western medicine alone for treatment of chronic superficial gastritis with the pooling result of overall improvement [OR 3.78 (1.29,11.06), P = 0.02]. In addition, the combination of HQJZ with antibiotics has higher overall effect rate than antibiotics alone for the treatment of CG [OR 2.60 (1.49,4.54), P = 0.0007]. There were no serious adverse events reported in both the intervention and controlled groups. HQJZ has the potential of improvement of the patients' gastroscopy outcomes, Helicobacter pylori clearance rate, traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes, and overall effect rate alone or in combination use with conventional western medicine for chronic atrophic gastritis. However, due to poor methodological quality, the beneficial effect and safeties of HQJZ for CG could not be confirmed.

25417408|t|Effect of Sini San freeze-dried powder on sleep-waking cycle in insomnia rats.
25417408|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the Sini San at different doses on each sleeping state [slow-wave sleep 1 (SWS 1), slow-wave sleep 2 (SWS2), rapid-eye-movement (REM), wakefulness (W)] in insomnia rats and to identify its mode of action for improving sleep. METHODS: The insomnia rats were randomly divided into a high-, medium- or low-dose group of Sini San (equal to crude drug 8.8, 4.4, or 2.2 g/kg, respectively) for seven consecutive days. RESULTS: Compared with pre-administration, SWS2 was significantly increased after administration of the low dose. Compared with pre-administration, W was significantly decreased and SWS1, SWS2, and the total sleeping time (TST) were markedly increased after administration of the medium dose. Compared with pre-administration, W was significantly decreased and SWS1, SWS2, rapid-eye-movement sleep, and TST were significantly longer after administration of the high dose. The effects of Sini San on sleep-wake cycle are dose-dependent. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Sini San extends SWS1 and SWS2, which increases the total sleeping time.

31572178|t|Conventional Western Treatment Combined With Chinese Herbal Medicine Alleviates the Progressive Risk of Lung Cancer in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Nationwide Retrospective Cohort Study.
31572178|a|Background and purpose: Lung cancer has high global incidence and mortality rates. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is strongly associated with lung cancer and is an independent risk factor for lung cancer with or without smoking. Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are used to treat COPD. This study sought to determine whether CHM treatment effectively decreases the incidence of lung cancer in COPD patients receiving conventional Western medical treatment. Methods: Records obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) were used to identify 81,780 adults aged >/=18 years newly diagnosed with COPD in Taiwan between 2000 and 2010. Among them, 11,180 received CHMs after COPD diagnosis and 23,319 did not (non-CHM). After excluding patients with missing basic demographic information, each group consisted of 2,682 patients. Statistical methods analyzed the baseline characteristics for both groups and we performed a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to examine the incidence of lung cancer. The cumulative incidence of lung cancer in COPD patients with or without CHM treatment was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The association between herbs and formulas was examined by NodeXL to perform a network analysis of CHM. Results: COPD patients using CHM had a lower risk for lung cancer (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR] = 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-0.53, p < 0.001). Older age was associated with a higher risk of lung cancer: patients aged 40-59 years (aHR = 5.32, 95% CI = 2.19-12.94, p < 0.001) and those aged >/=60 years (aHR = 16.75, 95% CI = 7.54-37.23, p < 0.001) were at significantly greater risk compared with patients aged 18-39 years. CHM use was associated with a trend for a lower cumulative incidence of lung cancer compared with non-CHM use (p < 0.001). Among the 10 most commonly used single herbs and formulas used to decrease the risk of lung cancer in COPD patients, Fritillariae thunbergii was the most commonly used single herb and Xiao Qing Long Tang the most commonly used formula. Conclusion: The findings from this nationwide retrospective cohort study indicate that CHM as adjunctive therapy in COPD treatment regimens may reduce the risk of lung cancer in this vulnerable patient population.

14758024|t|Preventive effect of Juzen-taiho-to on endometrial carcinogenesis in mice is based on Shimotsu-to constituent.
14758024|a|Juzen-taiho-to, a Kampo formula, originally consists of a mixture of Shimotsu-to and Shikunshi-to formulas together with two other crude ingredients. Juzen-taiho-to is reported to have a preventive effect on endometrial carcinogenesis in mice. Shimotsu-to exerts an inhibitory effect on estrogen-induced expression of c-fos, interleukin (IL)-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in uteri of ovarectomized mice. In the present study, short- and long-term experiments were designed to determine the effects of Juzen-taiho-to and Shimotsu-to on the estrogen-related endometrial carcinogenesis in mouse uteri, associated with the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2. In the short-term experiment, exposure to Juzen-taiho-to or Shimotsu-to significantly reduced estradiol-17beta (E(2))-stimulated expressions of COX-2 mRNA (p<0.05) as well as the protein. However, no effects on the expression of COX-1 were observed. Shikunshi-to did not affect COX expression. In the long-term experiment, 90 female ICR mice were given N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) into their uterine corpora. The animals were divided into four groups as follows: group 1, a diet containing 0.07% Shimotsu-to and 5 ppm E(2); group 2, a diet containing 5 ppm E(2); group 3, a diet containing 0.07% Shimotsu-to; group 4 served as a control. Exposure of Shimotsu-to reduced the incidence of MNU- and E(2)-induced endometrial adenocarcinoma and atypical hyperplasia at the termination of the experiment (30 weeks). The above findings and our previous reports suggest that Shimotsu-to is responsible for the preventive effects of Juzen-taiho-to on estrogen-related endometrial carcinogenesis in mice, through the inhibition of estrogen-related COX-2 as well as c-fos, IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha expressions.

23258998|a|Objectives. To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (LWDHW), combined with antihypertensive drugs, for essential hypertension. Methods. Five major electronic databases were searched up to August 2012 to retrieve any potential randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs for essential hypertension reported in any language, with main outcome measures as blood pressure. The quality of the included studies was assessed with the Jadad scale and a customized standard quality assessment scale. Results. 6 randomized trials were included. The methodological quality of the trials was evaluated as generally low. The pooled results showed that LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs was more effective in blood pressure and the scale for TCM syndrome and symptom differentiation scores compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. Most of the trials did not report adverse events, and the safety is still uncertain. Conclusions. LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs appears to be effective in improving blood pressure and symptoms in patients with essential hypertension. However, the evidence remains weak due to the poor methodological quality of the included studies.

32006382|t|A Network Pharmacology-Based Study of the Molecular Mechanisms of Shaoyao-Gancao Decoction in Treating Parkinson's Disease.
32006382|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is another major neurodegenerative disorder following Alzheimer's disease, which not only seriously reduces the survival in patients, affecting patient's quality of life, but also imposes a tremendous burden on families and even the whole society. It is urgent to find out effective drugs without side effects. The present study applied a creative approach called network pharmacology to explore the active compounds and therapeutic targets of Shaoyao-Gancao Decoction (SYGCD) for treating PD. We identified a total of 48 active compounds mediating 30 PD-related targets to exert synergism, and the same target can be enriched in multiple signal pathways and biological processes, expounding that the decoction can exert synergistic effect on PD by multi-targets and multi-pathways. Furthermore, the molecular docking analysis showed that active compounds and targets can be well combined. These results highlighted the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficiency of SYGCD for PD treatment at a systematic level, investigating thoroughly the innovative therapeutic tactics for PD in traditional Chinese medicine.

24812907|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Xiaoyao Powder (XP) and its compatible prescriptions on the ethology, morphology, and activities of neurotransmitters, thus exploring their effects and mechanism in preventing and treating D-galactose induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice, and clarifying the compatibility mechanism for soothing Gan, nourishing blood, and invigorating Pi. METHODS: Sixty SPF mice were randomly divided into the blank control group, the model group, and the XP group, Shugan Jianpi group (SJ), Shugan Yangxue group (SY), and Jianpi Yangxue group (JY), 10 in each group.The AD mouse model was prepared by peritoneal injecting D-galactose. Meanwhile, mice in the blank control group and the model group were administered with physiological saline (at the daily dose of 24 mL/kg) by gastrogavage. Mice in the XP group (2.485 g/kg), the SY group (1.136 g/kg), the SJ group (1.775 g/kg), and the JY group (2.059 g/kg) were administered with corresponding medicated decoction by gastrogavage, with the gastric volume of 24 mL/kg. On the 41st day the training of capability for learning and memory was started. On the 42nd day capability for learning and memory was tested. The brain tissue was cut. One half was used to determine the contents of homogenate acetyl cholinesterase (AchE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and monoamine oxidase (MAO).Another half was used to carry out morphological observations. RESULTS: The capability for learning and memory could be improved and the latency time could be lowered in all the treatment groups. Besides, the homogenate AchE and MAO could also be elevated, ChAT could be lowered; the morphology, number, and distribution of neurons could be improved. But the improvement of ethology, morphology, and activities of neurotransmitters were most obviously seen in the XP group. CONCLUSIONS: XP could improve the ethology, morphology, and activities of neurotransmitters, and showed better effects on prevention and treatment of AD. The rationality of compatibility methods and combination thinking ways of soothing Gan, nourishing blood, and invigorating Pi were clarified.

METHODS: A total of 2 x10(6) Hepa1 -6 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank of 15 C57BL/6 mice to establish a mice model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Then the mice were randomly divided into three groups, i.e., the model group, the DDP group, and the DDP + YPFP group, 5 in each group. Mice in the DDP group and the DDP + YPFP group were intraperitoneally injected with DDP (2. 5 mg/kg), once every three day for 2 weeks. Physiological saline was intraperitoneally injected to mice in the model group. Meanwhile, YPFP water decoction (25 g/kg) was given to mice in the DDP + YPFP group by gastrogavage once daily for 2 weeks. Corresponding distilled water was given by gastrogavage to mice in the DDP group and the model group. Fourteen days later, mice were sacrificed and the tumor inhibition ratio was calculated. The weights of kidneys, livers, and lungs were weighed and the organ coefficient calculated. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the tissue were detected. The pathologic changes were observed. RESULTS: The tumor weight obviously decreased in the DDP group and the DDP + YPFP group when compared with the model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Obvious oxidative damage existed in the kidneys and livers after induced by DDP. Oxidative damage also existed in the lungs to some extent. YPFP could obviously decrease the content of MDA and the activities of SOD in livers (P < 0.05), and increase the activities of SOD in lungs (P < 0.01). The pathologic changes showed the same effect trend. CONCLUSIONS: YPFP could protect the organs (kidney, liver, lung) from the oxidative damage induced by DDP. Anti-oxidation is one of its mechanisms.

25815775|t|Identification of active ingredients in Wuzhuyu decoction improving migraine in mice by spectral efficiency association.
25815775|a|Wuzhuyu decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine used for the effective treatment of migraines, termed 'Jueyin headache', in China. However, there have been few investigations to clarify the composition of Wuzhuyu decoction for the treatment of migraines. In the present study, 10 types of Wuzhuyu decoction were analyzed by chromatograms. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-depletion mouse models of migraine were prepared by subcutaneous injection of reserpine and placement of autologous blood clots in the cerebral cortex. The levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline (NE), dopamine (DA), nitric oxide (NO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the brain tissues and sera of the mice were determined. The ingredients and pharmacodynamic indices of the Wuzhuyu decoctions were analyzed using spectral efficiency association by partial least squares regression. The levels of 5-HT, NE and DA in the mouse brain tissues were reduced to 337.785 +/- 84.504, 171.173 +/- 65.172 and 242.075 +/- 158.621 mg/g brain tissue, respectively. The level of NO in the brain tissues increased to 0.425 +/- 0.184 micromol/g protein and the activities of NOS in the brain tissues and sera increased to 0.719 +/- 0.477 U/mg and 50.688 +/- 8.132 U/ml, respectively. Regarding the ingredients of the Wuzhuyu decoction, those with significant regression coefficients were ginsenoside-Rg1, Re, Rb1, rutaevine (Rv), limonin (Li), evodiamine (Ev), rutaecarpine (Ru) and substance X (awaiting identification). Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rv, Li, Ev, Ru and X in the Wuzhuyu decoction were observed to yield the pharmacological effects, whereas Rb1, Rv and Ev were important in index improvement.

14719288|t|Effects of da ding feng zhu decoction in 30 cases of liver fibrosis.
14719288|a|To study the clinical effects of Da Ding Feng Zhu ([symbol: see text]) Decoction on liver fibrosis. 56 patients with liver fibrosis due to chronic hepatitis B were randomly divided into a treatment group (30 cases treated with Da Ding Feng Zhu Decoction) and a control group (26 cases treated with colchicine). The serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), procollagen III (PC-III), IV collagen (IV-C) and Laminin (LN) of the patients were determined, compared and analyzed before treatment and after 3-month treatment in the two groups. The results showed that in the treatment group, the levels of HA, PC-III, IV-C and LN after 3-month treatment were significantly lowered as compared to that before treatment (P < 0.01). In the control group, only the HA level was obviously lowered (P < 0.05). There was an significant difference (P < 0.05) in PC-III and IV-C and a very significant difference (P < 0.01) in HA after treatment between the two groups. It is therefore concluded that Da Ding Feng Zhu Decoction can lower serum indexes of liver fibrosis.

29075536|t|Neural Plasticity Associated with Hippocampal PKA-CREB and NMDA Signaling Is Involved in the Antidepressant Effect of Repeated Low Dose of Yueju Pill on Chronic Mouse Model of Learned Helplessness.
29075536|a|Yueju pill is a traditional Chinese medicine formulated to treat syndromes of mood disorders. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effect of repeated low dose of Yueju in the animal model mimicking clinical long-term depression condition and the role of neural plasticity associated with PKA- (protein kinase A-) CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) signaling. We showed that a single low dose of Yueju demonstrated antidepressant effects in tests of tail suspension, forced swim, and novelty-suppressed feeding. A chronic learned helplessness (LH) protocol resulted in a long-term depressive-like condition. Repeated administration of Yueju following chronic LH remarkably alleviated all of depressive-like symptoms measured, whereas conventional antidepressant fluoxetine only showed a minor improvement. In the hippocampus, Yueju and fluoxetine both normalized brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and PKA level. Only Yueju, not fluoxetine, rescued the deficits in CREB signaling. The chronic LH upregulated the expression of NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B, which were all attenuated by Yueju. Furthermore, intracerebraventricular administration of NMDA blunted the antidepressant effect of Yueju. These findings supported the antidepressant efficacy of repeated routine low dose of Yueju in a long-term depression model and the critical role of CREB and NMDA signaling.

32397290|t|Banhahubak-Tang Tablet, a Standardized Medicine Attenuates Allergic Asthma via Inhibition of Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1)/ Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 6 (STAT6) Signal Pathway.
32397290|a|Exposure to particulate matter (PM) has been known to be one of the risk factors to cause allergic asthma, leading to development of respiratory disease. Banhahubak-tang tablet (BHT), a standardized Korean Medicine, is prescribed for neurasthenia, laryngopharyngitis and asthma. In this study, we investigated therapeutic effects of BHT on airway inflammation in ovalbumin (OVA) and PM smaller than 10 mum (PM10)-induced allergic asthma mice. To establish allergic asthma with airway hyper-responsiveness by PM10, BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and PM10, and orally administered BHT. Histological staining was performed to assess airway remodeling. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for measuring immunoglobulin levels and counting inflammatory cells, respectively. Expression levels of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 2 T-helper (Th2)-related cytokines were analyzed in vivo and in vitro models. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that BHT suppressed inflammatory cell infiltration, mucus hypersecretion and collagen deposition in the airway. BHT administration effectively decreased number of inflammatory cells in BALF. BHT reduced total serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. In addition, BHT significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT6 expressions. Release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Th2-related cytokines were down-regulated by BHT. In conclusion, BHT mitigated airway inflammation by down-regulating pro-inflammatory and Th2-related cytokines via JAK1/STAT6 signaling. BHT might be a promising herbal medicine for preventing airway inflammation. Moreover, an intervention study among humans is needed to further evaluate the possible beneficial effects of BHT in allergic asthma.

31075381|t|Effects and mechanism of action of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang in atopic dermatitis-like skin dysfunction in vivo and in vitro.
31075381|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Atopic dermatitis (AD), a disorder prevalent during childhood and adulthood, seriously affects the patient's quality of life. Although Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT) has shown anti-inflammatory effects in previous studies, its effects and mechanism of action underlying AD disorder are still largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of HLJDT on the AD-like dermal disorder, induced in vitro by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered inflammation, and in vivo by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo HLJDT effects were investigated by determining the severity of dermatitis, which consisted of observing signs of skin lesions, visually and through haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, in mouse ears and dorsal skin, measuring serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and determining the splenic index, number of splenic CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, as well as the phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (including MAPKs-p38, ERK, and JNK), IkappaB-alpha, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) (p65) within dermal lesions. Morphological changes in LPS-induced inflammation were observed under a microscope, and ELISA and qPCR assays were used to measure IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha expression levels. The protein expression levels of P-ERK/ERK, P-p38/p38, P-JNK/JNK, P-IKbeta-alpha, and P-p65 were measured through western blotting. Additionally, p65 expression was assessed by immunofluorescence, and LPS binding to RAW264.7cell membrane was studied with laser confocal microscopy. RESULTS: HLJDT could remarkably mitigate DNCB-induced AD-like lesion symptoms, alleviating inflammatory mediator infiltration in mouse ears and dorsal skin tissue, down-regulating serum expression levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha, normalising the splenic CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-lymphocyte ratio, and inactivating MAPKs (including p38, ERK, and JNK), IkappaB-alpha, and NF-kappaB (p65) in dorsal skin. Furthermore, HLJDT inhibited LPS-induced differentiation of RAW264.7cells, as evidenced by the decreased protein and mRNA expression of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Additionally, it decreased ERK, p38, JNK, IKbeta-alpha, and p65 phosphorylation levels in the MAPKs/NF-kappaB pathway, inhibited p65 nuclear translocation, and reduced LPS binding to the RAW264.7cell membrane. CONCLUSIONS: HLJDT significantly improved AD-like symptoms via inhibition of the MAPKs/NF-kappaB pathway. Therefore, administration of HLJDT might be a potential treatment for AD in the clinical setting.

34434895|t|An Integrative Metabolomic and Network Pharmacology Study Revealing the Regulating Properties of Xihuang Pill That Improves Anlotinib Effects in Lung Cancer.
34434895|a|Lung cancer ranks as a leading cause of death. Although targeted therapies usually trigger profound initial patient responses, these effects are transient due to drug resistance and severe side effects. Xihuang Pill (XHW) is a popular Chinese medicine formula that might benefit cancer patients when used as a complementary therapy. However, its underlying mechanism when combined with anticancer drugs is not clearly understood. Here, we used an integrated strategy to reveal the regulatory properties of XHW in increasing the antitumor activity of anlotinib in lung cancer. We evaluated the anti-lung cancer effect of XHW combined with anlotinib in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). We applied untargeted metabolomics to identify the differences metabolism and found that XHW improved the effects of anlotinib on lung cancer. The components and targets related to the effects of XHW treatment on lung cancer were obtained through network pharmacology. Then, by integrating the biologically active components of XHW and anlotinib as well as the treatment-responsive metabolites and their related targets, an interaction network was constructed to evaluate the combination therapy. Finally, important protein candidates for this response were verified by immunohistochemistry of tumor tissues. The results showed that XHW significantly improved the inhibitory effect of anlotinib on tumor growth in LLC-bearing mice. Additionally, 12 differentially-abundant metabolites were identified by untargeted metabolomics in the XHW/anlotinib group compared with the XHW or anlotinib groups, and they were mainly enriched in fatty acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism pathways. Anlotinib, 23 components in Shexiang, 2 components in Niuhuang, 30 components in Ruxiang and 60 components in Moyao work together to act on 30 targets to regulate hexadecanoic acid (also named palmitic acid), linoleic acid, lactosylceramide, adrenaline, arachidonic acid and lysoPC(18:1(9Z)). The results of immunohistochemistry showed that XHW combined with anlotinib reduced the expression of PDGFRA in tumors. Overall, the key metabolites of XHW that enhances the efficacy of anlotinib were regulated by a multicomponent and multitarget interaction network. Our results suggested that anlotinib combined with XHW may be a promising strategy for the treatment of lung cancer.

25039190|t|[Experimental study on anti-tumor effect of xihuang pill and its immune clearance function].
25039190|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the anti-tumor effect of Xihuang pill on tumor-bearing rats and its effect on the immune clearance function of tumor-bearing organisms. METHOD: Walker256 tumor cells were adopted to establish the tumor-bearing rat model. The rats were randomly divided into five groups: the normal control group, the model control group, the lentinan group and Xihuang pill low dose, middle dose and high dose groups, with 10 rats in each group, and continuously treated and given drugs for 14 d after modeling. Blood and tumors were collected from abdominal aorta to calculate the tumor inhibition rate. The content of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and adhesion molecule B7-1 (CD80) in peripheral blood were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The expressions of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in were determined by ELISA. RESULT: The tumor inhibition rate of the Xihuang pill high dose group was 33. 1 percent. Compared with the model group, the Xihuang pill large dose group showed significantly low IL-2, IFN-gamma, CD3+, CD4+, B7-1 in peripheral blood, with statistical significance in their differences (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Xihuang pill could show its anti-tumor effect by enhancing the immune clearance function and increasing IL-2, IFN-gamma, CD3+ T, CD4+ T, B7-1 in peripheral blood.

33653242|t|Exploring miRNA-related Molecular Targets of Erchen Decoction against Lipid Metabolism Disorder using a Network Pharmacologic Approach.
33653242|a|BACKGROUND: Erchen Decoction (ECD) is a complex herbal formulation widely used for treating lipid metabolism disorder (LMD) in China. This study aims to explore the microRNA (miRNA)-related molecular targets of ECD against LMD using a network pharmacology approach (NPA) Methods: We randomly divided 20 male Sprague Dawley rats into two groups; 10 rats were normal controls, and the other 10 rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to establish an LMD model. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRs, HFD vs. Control) in the rats' liver tissues were identified by miRNA sequencing and validated with qRT-PCR. Finally, the miRNArelated molecular targets for ECD activity against LMD were identified using a standard NPA by finding the intersection between identified DE-miRs-related targets and ECD-related targets. RESULT: We identified 8 DE-miRs and 968 targets and compared them to 262 ECD-related targets. A final list of 22 candidate targets was identified. Using a confidence score of >0.4, the network of (protein-protein interaction) PPI relationships exhibited 22 nodes and 67 edges. The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed 171 molecular targets and 59 pathways, which were associated with ECD against LMD. CONCLUSION: The identified molecular targets and pathways suggest that complex mechanisms are involved in ECD's mechanism of action, and immune-inflammation-related mechanisms are closely associated with the effects of ECD. The targets obtained in this study will guide future studies on the pharmacologic effects of ECD.

28074099|t|A Network Pharmacology Approach to Explore the Pharmacological Mechanism of Xiaoyao Powder on Anovulatory Infertility.
28074099|a|Aim. To explore the pharmacological mechanism of Xiaoyao powder (XYP) on anovulatory infertility by a network pharmacology approach. Method. Collect XYP's active compounds by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) databases, and input them into PharmMapper to get their targets. Then note these targets by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and filter out targets that can be noted by human signal pathway. Get the information of modern pharmacology of active compounds and recipe's traditional effects through databases. Acquire infertility targets by Therapeutic Target Database (TTD). Collect the interactions of all the targets and other human proteins via String and INACT. Put all the targets into the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to do GO enrichment analysis. Finally, draw the network by Cytoscape by the information above. Result. Six network pictures and two GO enrichment analysis pictures are visualized. Conclusion. According to this network pharmacology approach some signal pathways of XYP acting on infertility are found for the first time. Some biological processes can also be identified as XYP's effects on anovulatory infertility. We believe that evaluating the efficacy of TCM recipes and uncovering the pharmacological mechanism on a systematic level will be a significant method for future studies.

19100323|t|Extract of the Chinese herbal formula Huo Luo Xiao Ling Dan inhibited adjuvant arthritis in rats.
19100323|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The herbal formula Huo Luo Xiao Ling Dan (HLXL) and its modifications have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for about one hundred years to alleviate pain and inflammation. AIM: To investigate the effects of HLXL on complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced multiple-joint arthritis in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Lewis rats, 190-210 g, were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 200 microl of heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mineral oil (5 mg/ml). HLXL (2.30 and 4.60 g/kg) or vehicle control (n=8 per group) was administered orally (i.g.) once a day between days 16 and 25 post-CFA injection. The rats were observed for signs of arthritis with arthritic changes (erythema, edema, induration) being scored on a scale of 0-4 of increasing severity using a standard scoring system. The maximum arthritis score per rat was 16. A plethysmometer was used to measure edema volume in each paw. Adverse effects of HLXL were monitored by closely observing the animals for unusual behavioral changes. Levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) in local tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on day 25 post-CFA. RESULTS: HLXL significantly decreased arthritis scores between days 23-25 in the 2.30 g/kg group and 21-25 in the 4.60 g/kg group (p<0.05). It reduced paw edema on days 22 and 24 in the 2.30 g/kg group and on days 20, 22 and 24 in the 4.60 g/kg group compared to control (p<0.05). Local tissue TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels on day 25 post-CFA injection were significantly (p<0.05) lower in rats treated with HLXL than in control rats. No observable adverse effects were found. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that HLXL produces significant anti-arthritic effects that may be mediated by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and it appears to be safe.

23754163|t|Reciprocal effects of Guizhi decoction to the Guizhi decoction syndrome by toll-like receptor mRNA expression and cytokines secretion.
23754163|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the pathological mechanisms of Guizhi Decoction () syndrome and the therapeutic molecular mechanisms of the Guizhi Decoction, Mahuang Decoction (), Sangju Decoction ( ) and Yinqiao Powder (), as well as the potentially biological basis that Guizhi Decoction is most effective only for the patients with Guizhi Decoction syndrome in clinical practice. METHODS: We first got serum samples from the patients suffering from both upper respiratory tract infection and Guizhi Decoction syndrome identified by the doctors of Chinese medicine (CM) in the clinic. Four formulas with therapeutic actions of pungent warmth or pungent coolness for superficial syndromes were chosen and four kinds of rat serum samples each containing one of the above-mentioned herbal formulas were collected, then the effects of Guizhi Decoction syndromes' patient serum as well as the effects of sera containing the formulas after being stimulated by the patient serum samples on both the mRNA expression of certain toll-like receptor (TLR) subtypes and the release of some inflammatory cytokines in RAW264.7 cells were tested and analyzed in vitro. RESULTS: The expression of TLR-3, TLR-4 and TLR-9 mRNA among the 9 tested TLR subforms were up-regulated in the macrophages stimulated by the sera from untreated upper respiratory infection patients with the Guizhi Decoction syndrome (symptomcomplex). The products such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-beta from stimulated macrophages through TLR signaling pathways were also increased correspondingly. Interestingly, the changes induced by the Guizhi Decoction syndrome patients' sera were masked significantly after the macrophages were incubated with the sera from donors treated with Guizhi Decoction. Similarly, the three other exterior-releasing formulas were all effective in reversing the up-regulated changes of certain TLR subforms to different degrees, but both the number of targeted TLRs and efficacy of them seemed to be inferior to that of Guizhi Decoction. CONCLUSION: Evidence from these experiments might contribute to the scientific explanation of both the pharmacological mechanisms of Guizhi Decoction and also the CM theory that Guizhi Decoction is specifically prescribed for the treatment of Guizhi Decoction syndrome (The gearing formula to the symptom-complex).

33144867|t|Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulation Huangqi Jianzhong Tang Improves Cardiac Function after Myocardial Infarction in Rats.
33144867|a|Huangqi Jianzhong Tang (HQJZT) is a traditional Chinese herbal formula consisting of seven different herbs: Radix Astragali, Radix Paeoniae Alba, Ramulus Cinnamomi, Fructus Jujubae, Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle, Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens, and Saccharum Granorum. The present study aims to evaluate the possible effects of HQJZT on cardiac function in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and related mechanism. AMI model was established by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by one-week HQJZT treatment. Survival rate was calculated. Rat heart function was assessed by heart performance analysis system. 5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used to observe myocardial infarct size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and western blot were applied to evaluate tissue apoptotic level. Treatment with high dose of HQJZT improved cardiac function, reduced infarct size, number of apoptotic cells and expression of apoptotic proteins, Bax (a proapoptotic protein), and increased expression of antiapoptotic protein, Bcl2. However, enalapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) treatment did not show marked improvement of these parameters. Our present data suggest that HQJZT has potential therapeutic effects to improve cardiac function by regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway.

34504536|t|Mechanism by Which Tong Xie Yao Fang Heals the Intestinal Mucosa of Rats with Ulcerative Colitis through the Hippo Pathway.
34504536|a|OBJECTIVE: Tong Xie Yao Fang (TXYF) is a classic and effective prescription in traditional Chinese medicine which is used to treat ulcerative colitis (UC). Our study investigated the effect of TXYF on Hippo pathway activation in UC-induced intestinal mucosa injury and explored the possible mechanism. METHOD: After ulcerative colitis was successfully induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), 48 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into a control group, model group, TXYF group, and sulfasalazine group and treated with the corresponding drugs for 28 days. The parameters including body weight, colon length, spleen index, and disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological characteristics were assessed. The myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and IL-6 level in the colon mucosa were determined with the corresponding commercial kits. The expressions of the Hippo pathway components YAP1, TAZ, P-YAP, and LATS1 were detected in the colon mucosa of each group on different stages by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate the growth and apoptosis of the colon epithelium. RESULT: TXYF significantly improved the weight loss, colonic shortening, DAI, spleen enlargement, and histopathological score of the rats with TNBS-induced UC. TXYF also reduced the MPO activity and expression of IL-6 in the colon mucosa. Furthermore, treatment with TXYF significantly increased YAP1 expression in the early stage (3-7 days) and significantly decreased YAP1 expression in the late stage (14-28 days). In the early stage, TXYF inhibited Hippo pathway activity, which promoted proliferation and regeneration of the intestinal mucosa. In the late stage, the Hippo pathway was activated, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and promoting intestinal mucosal differentiation. CONCLUSION: TXYF alleviated the inflammatory response and promoted mucosal healing in rats with UC, which was probably achieved through the Hippo pathway. These results indicated that TXYF was a potential therapy for treating UC.

31553364|t|System-Pharmacology Dissection of Traditional Chinese herbs SINI Decoction for Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases.
31553364|a|Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are leading causes of death in the world, owing to noticeable incidence and mortality. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) SINI Decoction (SND) is used to prevent and treat CVDs, which has attracted extensive attention for its moderate and little side effects. However, the involved molecular mechanisms are exceedingly complicated and remain unclear. Systems pharmacology, as a novel approach that integrates systems biology and pharmacology plays a significant role in investigating the molecular mechanism of TCM. In systems pharmacology approach, we use to systematically uncover the mechanisms of action in Chinese medicinal formula SND as an effective treatment for CVDs, which mainly includes:1) molecular database building; 2) ADME evaluation; 3) target-fishing 4) network construction and analysis. The results show that 78 underlying valid ingredients and their corresponding 71 direct targets of SND were obtained. And SND take part in cardiomyocyte protection, blood pressure regulation, and lipid regulation module in treatment of CVDs by cooperative way. Systems pharmacology as an emerging field that investigates the molecular mechanisms of TCM through pharmacokinetic evaluation target prediction, and pathway analysis, which will facilitate the development of traditional Chinese herbs in modern medicine.

8044302|t|Effect of traditional Chinese medicine (sairei-to) on monoclonal antibody-induced proteinuria in rats.
8044302|a|The effects of traditional Chinese medicine (Sairei-to) on monoclonal antibody (mAb) inducing proteinuria were examined. Four hundred, 200 and 100 mg/kg body weight (BW) of Sairei-to and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control were injected intraperitoneally into four groups of female Wistar rats every day from 5 days before intravenous injection of mAb to the end of the experimental period. The amount of urinary protein excretion was significantly suppressed in roughly a dose-dependent manner. For example, 116.6 +/- 89.7 mg/day of proteinuria was observed in control groups compared to 4.2 +/- 15.2 mg/day in the 400 mg/kg BW of Sairei-to treated group 2 days after mAb injection (P < 0.01). Statistically significant (P < 0.01) differences were again observed in a repeat experiment (122.1 +/- 53.7 vs 10.2 +/- 10.1 mg/day on the 2nd day) without affecting the glomerular filtration rate. No significant difference was recognized between the total amount of mAb bound to glomeruli 1 h after mAb injection in Sairei-to-treated and non-treated rats, indicating that Sairei-to pretreatment has no effects on the number or quality of antigenic molecules. The effect of Sairei-to on a non-immunological model of proteinuria was also examined. No significant reduction of proteinuria by similar Sairei-to treatment was observed in aminonucleoside of puromycin nephropathy. The authors conclude that mAb-induced proteinuria in rats is significantly suppressed by the traditional Chinese medicine, Sairei-to.

24660594|t|Protective effect of Sijunzi decoction on neuromuscular junction ultrastructure in autoimmune myasthenia gravis rats.
24660594|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective role of Sijunzi decoction in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and muscle cell mitochondria ultrastructure; as well as its effects on the amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II, III, and IV in autoimmune myasthenia gravis rats. METHODS: An experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) rat model was established by inoculating rats with acetylcholine receptors extracted from Torpedo. Rats were divided into three groups: model, prednisone, and Sijunzi decoction, and were fed physiological saline, prednisone, or Sijunzi decoction, respectively. NMJ and muscle cell mitochondria ultrastructure were observed by transmission electron microscope. The amount of ATP was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. The activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II, III, and IV was determined using the Clark oxygen electrode method. RESULTS: In the model group, there were sparse muscle fibers, with decreased mitochondria, and sparse, diffluent, or absent NMJ folds. After intervention with Sijunzi decoction, the above pathology changes were improved: muscle fiber structure was clear and complete; the mitochondria count was higher; and the NMJ structure was close to normal. Gastrocnemius muscle mitochondria in the model group produced significantly less ATP than those in the prednisone group (P < 0.01). Conversely, the ATP of Sijunzi decoction group was significantly higher than prednisone group (P < 0.01). The activities of gastrocnemius muscle mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II, III, and IV in both the prednisone and Sijunzi decoction groups was dramatically higher compared with the model group (P < 0.05). The activities of complexes I and III in the Sijunzi decoction group were significantly higher than those in the prednisone group (P < 0.05), but there was no obvious difference in complex II or IV activities between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Sijunzi decoction improved pathological changes in muscle mitochondria and NMJ, enhanced the amount of ATP in gastrocnemius muscle mitochondria, and improved the activities of respiratory chain complexes I, II, III, and IV (especially I and III) of the EAMG rats.
24660594|k|CONCLUSION: Sijunzi decoction improved pathological changes in muscle mitochondria and NMJ, enhanced the amount of ATP in gastrocnemius muscle mitochondria, and improved the activities of respiratory chain complexes I, II, III, and IV (especially I and III) of the EAMG rats.

32169932|t|Decreased risk of colorectal cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes receiving Chinese herbal medicine: a population-based cohort study.
32169932|a|OBJECTIVES: Patients with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), but whether Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) can reduce this risk is unknown. This study investigated the effect that CHMs have on CRC risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cohort study used the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 54 744 patients, newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, aged 20-70 years, who were receiving treatment between 1998 and 2007. From this sample, we randomly selected 14 940 CHMs users and 14 940 non-CHMs users, using propensity scores matching. All were followed through 2012 to record CRC incidence. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) of CRC by CHMs use. RESULTS: During follow-up, 235 CHMs users and 375 non-CHMs users developed CRC, incidence rates of 1.73% and 2.47% per 1000 person-years, respectively. CHM users had a significantly reduced risk of CRC compared with non-CHM users (adjusted HR=0.71; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). The greatest effect was in those receiving CHMs for more than 1 year. Huang-Qin, Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang, Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang, Liu-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan, Ji-Sheng-Shen-Qi-Wan, Gan-Lu-Yin, Shao-Yao-Gan-Cao-Tang and Ban-Xia-Xie-Xin-Tang were significantly associated with lower risk of CRC. CONCLUSION: Integrating CHMs into the clinical management of patients with type 2 diabetes may be beneficial in reducing the risk of CRC.

32767929|t|Theoretical Study of the Molecular Mechanism of Maxingyigan Decoction Against COVID-19: Network Pharmacology-based Strategy.
32767929|a|AIM AND OBJECTIVE: Maxingyigan (MXYG) decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription. However, how MXYG acts against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not known. We investigated the active ingredients and the therapeutic targets of MXYG decoction against COVID-19. METHODS: A network pharmacology strategy involving drug-likeness evaluation, prediction of oral bioavailability, network analyses, and virtual molecular docking was used to predict the mechanism of action of MXYG against COVID-19. RESULTS: Thirty-three core COVID-19-related targets were identified from 1023 gene targets through analyses of protein-protein interactions. Eighty-six active ingredients of MXYG decoction hit by 19 therapeutic targets were screened out by analyses of a compound-compound target network. Via network topology, three "hub" gene targets (interleukin (IL-6), caspase-3, IL-4) and three key components (quercetin, formononetin, luteolin) were recognized and verified by molecular docking. Compared with control compounds (ribavirin, arbidol), the docking score of quercetin to the IL-6 receptor was highest, with a score of 5. Furthermore, the scores of three key components to SARS-CoV-2 are large as 4, 5, and 5, respectively, which are even better than those of ribavirin at 3. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that MXYG could prevent and treat COVID-19 through anti-inflammatory and immunity-based actions involving activation of T cells, lymphocytes, and leukocytes, as well as cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, and chemokine signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: The hub genes of COVID-19 helped to reveal the underlying pathogenesis and therapeutic targets of COVID-19. This study represents the first report on the molecular mechanism of MXYG decoction against COVID-19.

24444307|t|Soyo-san reduces depressive-like behavior and proinflammatory cytokines in ovariectomized female rats.
24444307|a|BACKGROUND: Soyo-san is a traditional oriental medicinal formula, a mixture of 9 crude drugs, and it has been clinically used for treating mild depressive disorders. The role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in psychiatric disorders has been the focus of great research attention in recent years. In the present study, we detected the antidepressant effect of soyo-san in the ovariectomized and repeated stressed female rats. METHODS: This study was designed to evaluate the antidepressant-like effect of soyo-san on the forced swimming test (FST). The rats were randomly divided into the following groups: the nonoperated and nonstressed group (non-op), the nonoperated and stressed group (non-op + ST), the ovariectomized and stress group (OVX) and sham operated and stressed group (sham), the ovariectomized and stressed group (OVX + ST), the ovariectomized, stressed and soyo-san 100 mg/kg treated group (SOY100) and the ovariectomized, stressed and soyo-san 400 mg/kg treated group (SOY400). The rats were exposed to immobilization stress (IMO) for 14 day (2 h/14 day), and soyo-san (100 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) was administrated during the same time. In the same animals, the levels of corticosterone and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1beta) were examined in the serum. Also, the change of IL-1beta expression in brain regions was examined after behavior test. RESULTS: In the FST, the lower dose (100 mg/kg) of extract was effective in reducing immobility, along with an increase in swimming time. The serum levels of corticosterone and IL-1beta in the SOY groups were significantly lower than those in the control group. In the brain, the expression of IL-1beta positive neurons in the control group were significantly increased in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and hippocampus compared to the non-op. However, soyo-san groups significantly reduced the IL-1beta-ir neurons in the PVN and hippocampal regions compared to the control. CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrated that soyo-san effectively reduced behavioral and patho-physiological depression-like responses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Our results suggest that soyo-san may be useful for immune regulator in repeated stress-induced ovariectomized female rats.

32185949|t|Effect of Zuogui pill and Yougui pill on osteoporosis: a randomized controlled trial.
32185949|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect and safety of Zuogui pill and Yougui pill, classic Yin and Yang tonic formula (CYYTF), in the treatment of osteoporosis and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Participants aged 55 to 75 with osteoporosis and Kidney deficiency in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) will be included and randomly allocated into two groups: treatment group and control group. Participants in the treatment group were treated with Zuogui pill or Yougui pill TCM formula granule, while the control group received placebo. Primary outcomes are the lumbar spine on bone mineral density (BMD) (L1-4) and femoral BMD. Secondary outcomes include pain intensity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), bone turnover markers and safety. RESULTS: Totally 200 patients were enrolled from December 2014 to April 2016 from four hospitals. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at baseline (P > 0.05) and it was good to comparability. Statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed for the lumbar BMD (L1-4), pain VAS scores and HRQoL at six months and twelve months and femoral BMD at twelve months (P < 0.05), but no significant differences for femoral BMD and bone turnover markers at six months (P > 0.05). Moreover, significant difference was observed at different time before and after treatment in terms of lumbar spine (L1-4) BMD, femoral BMD, pain VAS scores and health-related quality of life, and there was an crossover effect between the time and groups before and after treatment. In additional, in the treatment group, 8 patients lost to follow-up and 3 patients had adverse events (AEs) and in the control group, 10 patients lost to follow-up and 2 patients had AEs. No remarkable differences were observed between the two groups with regard to AEs, lost rate and safety (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Zuogui pill or Yougui pill could improve BMD, ease pain, relieve Kidney deficiency syndrome, improve the quality of life osteoporosis patients, inhibit bone conversion and regulate the coupling balance of bone formation and bone resorption, but long-term efficacy should be confirmed by a longer term follow-up and larger of samples clinical randomized controlled trials.

32269530|t|HuangqiGuizhiWuwu Decoction Prevents Vascular Dysfunction in Diabetes via Inhibition of Endothelial Arginase 1.
32269530|a|Hyperglycemia induces vascular endothelial dysfunction, which contributes to the development of vascular complication of diabetes. A classic prescription of traditional medicine, HuangqiGuizhiWuwu Decoction (HGWWD) has been used for the treatment of various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, which all are related with vascular pathology. The present study investigated the effect of HGWWD treatment in streptozocin (STZ)-induced vascular dysfunction in mouse models. In vivo studies were performed using wild type mice as well as arginase 1 knockout specific in endothelial cells (EC-A1(-/-)) of control mice, diabetes mice and diabetes mice treated with HGWWD (60 g crude drugs/kg/d) for 2 weeks. For in vitro studies, aortic tissues were treated with mice serum containing HGWWD with or without adenoviral arginase 1 (Ad-A1) transduction in high glucose (HG) medium. We found that HGWWD treatment restored STZ-induced impaired mean velocity and pulsatility index of mouse left femoral arteries, aortic pulse wave velocity and vascular endothelial relaxation accompanied by elevated NO production in the aorta and plasma, as well as reduced endothelial arginase activity and aortic arginase 1 expression. The protective effect of HGWWD is reversed by an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis. Meanwhile, the preventive effect of serum containing HGWWD in endothelial vascular dysfunction is completely blocked by Ad-A1 transduction in HG incubated aortas. HGWWD treatment further improved endothelial vascular dysfunction in STZ induced EC-A1(-/-) mice. This study demonstrates that HGWWD improved STZ-induced vascular dysfunction through arginase 1 - NO signaling, specifically targeting endothelial arginase 1.

35479305|t|Dan-Shen-Yin Granules Prevent Hypoxia-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension via STAT3/HIF-1alpha/VEGF and FAK/AKT Signaling Pathways.
35479305|a|Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays an important role in the treatment of complex diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases. However, it is hard to identify their modes of action on account of their multiple components. The present study aims to evaluate the effects of Dan-Shen-Yin (DSY) granules on hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (HPH), and then to decipher the molecular mechanisms of DSY. Systematic pharmacology was employed to identify the targets of DSY on HPH. Furthermore, core genes were identified by constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG) analysis. Related genes and pathways were verified using a hypoxia-induced mouse model and hypoxia-treated pulmonary artery cells. Based on network pharmacology, 147 potential targets of DSY on HPH were found, constructing a PPI network, and 13 hub genes were predicted. The results showed that the effect of DSY may be closely associated with AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and HIF-1 signaling pathways, as well as biological processes such as cell proliferation. Consistent with network pharmacology analysis, experiments in vivo demonstrated that DSY could prevent the development of HPH in a hypoxia-induced mouse model and alleviate pulmonary vascular remodeling. In addition, inhibition of STAT3/HIF-1alpha/VEGF and FAK/AKT signaling pathways might serve as mechanisms. Taken together, the network pharmacology analysis suggested that DSY exhibited therapeutic effects through multiple targets in the treatment of HPH. The inferences were initially confirmed by subsequent in vivo and in vitro studies. This study provides a novel perspective for studying the relevance of TCM and disease processes and illustrates the advantage of this approach and the multitargeted anti-HPH effect of DSY.

30618764|t|The Efficacy and Safety of a Fixed Combination of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Chronic Urticaria: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study.
30618764|a|Background: Chronic urticaria is a bothersome skin disease, and Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is commonly used as adjuvant therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the mixture of two CHM formula, Xiao-Feng-San (XFS) and Qing-Shang-Fang-Feng-Tang (QSFFT), in treating urticaria through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Methods: 78 participants entered the screening phase between November 2012 and August 2015. Participants were randomly and equally allocated in either CHM group (2 gm XFS and 2 gm QSFFT four times a day and 5 mg levocetirizine once daily for 28 days followed by 5 mg levocetirizine once daily alone for 28 days) or control group (placebo and 5 mg levocetirizine daily followed by 5 mg levocetirizine once daily for 28 days alone). Symptom improvement was set as the primary outcome, and the influence on sleep quality and changes in serum markers were used as secondary outcomes. Per protocol design was applied to the final analysis. Results: A total of 56 participants entered the final analysis stage. Participants in the CHM group had more prominent symptom relief on day 56 (the weekly urticaria activity score, UAS7, as 9.9 +/- 9.2 vs. 15.6 +/- 10.8, p = 0.038). In the CHM group, participants' symptom severity reduced progressively (trend analysis, p < 0.001) while the decreasing trend was less favored in the control group (trend analysis, p = 0.056). The life quality improved gradually in both groups, while the differences between CHM and control groups were statistically insignificant. For urticaria-related cytokines, interferon-gamma seemed to decrease positively in the CHM group (about 30.8% reduction from baseline, trend analysis p = 0.013). For safety issue, the CHM prescription was well-tolerated with no noticeable long-term side effects when compared to the control group. At 6-month follow-up of symptom changes after the end of the trial, the CHM group participants reported positive results in no recurrence or >/=50% improvement (36.3% in CHM group vs. 20% in Control group, p = 0.103). Conclusions: The combination of XFS and QSFFT tended to be feasible and tolerable adjuvant therapy for urticaria in addition to standard therapy. However, larger study population with longer follow-up duration may be still needed. Trial registration: NCT01715740 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

25553241|t|Effects of Chinese herbal medicine in combination with mitomycin C on gastric cancer cells.
25553241|a|Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is frequently used by cancer patients in Chinese community. It remains largely unknown about the interaction between CHM and chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, we evaluated 3 commonly used CHM formulas for cancer patients: Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang (BZYQT), Bao-Yuan-Tang (BYT), and Ju-Yuan-Jian (JYJ). We examined the effects of these 3 formulas in human gastric cancer cells MKN-74, in terms of cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction when used alone or in combination with mitomycin C (MMC). Cytotoxicity was determined by tetrazolium dye colorimetric assay. The 10% inhibitory concentration of CHM was used in this study. Cells were first exposed to CHM or phosphate buffered saline (as control) for 48 h. Then MMC at final concentration of 0.25 mug/ml was added to media for another 24-h. Among these 3 CHM formulas, BZYQT showed the most pronounced effect in augmenting MMC-induced cytotoxicity. The viability of MKN-74 cells was decreased to 43.1% when treated with BZYQT and MMC, compared to 94.9% with MMC alone. We subsequently examined apoptosis induction by quantitative florescent microscopy and single-strand DNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and found BZYQT did not enhance MMC-induced apoptosis. Our findings indicate BZYQT in combination with MMC induces cell death in gastric cancer cells via non-apoptotic mechanism. Our results provide a rationale for further investigation in the interaction of CHM and anti-cancer treatment.

21434353|t|[Inhibitory effect of chailing decoction on renal tubular epithelial phenotype transformation in rats with cyclosporine A-induced nephropathy].
21434353|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Chailing Decoction (CLD) on alpha-smooth muscular actin (alpha-SMA, a marker of renal tubular epithelial phenotype transformation) in rats with cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced nephropathy for investigate its mechanism of action in inhibiting tubulo-interstitial fibrosis. METHODS: Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were equally randomized into four groups: the normal group, the model group, the positive control group and the Chinese medicine (CM) group. Excepting those in the normal group received gastrogavage with olive oil, rats in the other three groups were made into nephropathy model by oral infusion of CsA 30 mg/ (kg x d) for 28 days. At the same time of modeling, rats in the positive control and CM groups were treated respectively with Valsartan 10 mg/(kg x d) and CLD 3 g/(kg x d). The mRNA and protein expressions of alpha-SMA in rats' kidney were detected by RT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemical and flow cytometry, and the mRNA expressions of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and collagen type III (Col III) were determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Levels of (alpha-SMA, TGF-beta1, and Col III were significantly higher in the model group than those in the normal group respectively (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), and the high levels were down-regulated in the positive control and CM groups after treatment (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CLD could retard the progress of renal interstitial fibrosis by way of inhibiting renal tubular epithelial phenotype transformation.

30972189|t|Restoration of immune suppressor function of regulatory B cells collected from patients with allergic rhinitis with Chinese medical formula Yupingfeng San.
30972189|a|Immune dysregulation, such as defects in immune suppressor function, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many immune disorders including allergic rhinitis (AR). Some Chinese traditional medical formulae have an immune regulatory function. This study aims to restore the immune suppressor function in regulatory B cells (Bregs) collected from AR patients with a Chinese medical formula, Yupingfeng San (YPFS). In this study, Bregs were isolated from blood samples collected from AR patients and healthy (HA) subjects. The capacity of Breg in suppressing effector T cell (Teff) proliferation was observed in an in vitro experiment to be used as an indicator of immune suppressor function of Breg. The effects of YPFS on promoting Bregs' immune suppressor functions were tested in a cell culture study. The results showed that the number of peripheral Breg in AR patients was not significantly different from that in HA subjects, while the immune suppressor function of AR Breg was compromised. Bcl2L12 expression was higher in AR Bregs than that in HA Bregs. A negative correlation was identified between expression of Bcl2L12 and IL-10 in AR Bregs. Exposure of AR Bregs to YPFS in the culture suppressed the expression of Bcl2L12 and improved their immune suppressor function. In conclusion, YPFS can restore the immune suppressor function of AR Bregs via inhibiting the expression of Bcl2L12. The data suggest that YPFS has the potential to be used in the improvement of immune dysfunction, such as AR.

2262881|t|[Protective activities of a Chinese medicine, hochu-ekki-to, to impairment of hematopoietic organs and to microbial infection].
2262881|a|Effect of Hochu-ekki-to (HET) on the number of peripheral leukocytes (PL) and their functions in cyclophosphamide (CY)-treated or gamma ray-irradiated mice was investigated. By treatment of mice with anticancer agent CY or gamma ray irradiation, unfavorable side effects usually occurred to impair hematopoietic organs, causing bone marrow disorder. However, it was significantly protected by oral administration of HET (1 g/kg/d) to CY-treated or gamma ray-irradiated mice. The numbers of neutrophils and monocytes in PL were restored to the normal level, and colony-stimulating factor (CSF) was induced in the sera of mice by HET in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of serum CSF reached a peak at 3h after HET administration. Colony-forming unit of bone marrow cells in the spleen adoptively transferred into syngeneic mice, that is defined as CFU-S, was extremely reduced by CY-treatment. However, when HET was orally administered, CFU-S of CY-treated mice was markedly stimulated, suggesting that bone marrow cells were reactivated for further proliferation and mobilization. HET enhanced other leukocyte functions in CY-treated mice; i.e., superoxide production of neutrophils and phagocytic activity of macrophages. Thus, oral administration of HET to CY-treated mice enforced protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.

33935731|t|Protective Effect of An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan Pre-treatment Against Experimental Cerebral Ischemia Injury via Regulating GSK-3beta/HO-1 Pathway.
33935731|a|An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan (AGNHW), a famous formula in traditional Chinese medicine, has been clinically used for centuries for treating cerebral diseases, but the protective effects of pre-treatment with AGNHW on cerebral ischemia have not yet been reported. The present study aimed to test such protective effects and elucidate the underlying mechanisms on cerebral ischemia in rats by phenotypic approaches (i.e. including the neurological functional score, cerebral infarct area, neuron apoptosis, and brain oxidative stress status) and target-based approaches (i.e. involving the GSK-3beta/HO-1 pathway). AGNHW was administered orally at the doses of 386.26, 772.52, and 1545.04 mg/kg respectively for 7 days to male Sprague-Dawley rats and then cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1.5 h. Pre-treatment with AGNHW significantly ameliorated ischemic damage to the brain in a dose-dependent manner, including reduction of the neurological deficit score and infarct area. AGNHW pre-treatment increased the number of Nissl(+) cells, NeuN(+) and DCX(+) cells, and decreased the number of Tunel(+) cells. Moreover, AGNHW reversed the up-regulation of ROS and MDA induced by cerebral ischemia. AGNHW pre-treatment increased the expression of p-GSK-3beta(Ser9)/GSK-3beta (glycogen synthase kinase-3beta) ratio and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These results firstly revealed that short-term pre-treatment of AGNHW could significantly protect the rats from injury caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, which support further clinical studies for disease prevention. The in vivo protective effect of AGNWH pre-treatment could be associated with its antioxidant properties by the activation of GSK-3beta-mediated HO-1 pathway.

31367159|t|Lingguizhugan decoction attenuates diet-induced obesity and hepatosteatosis via gut microbiota.
31367159|a|BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major risk factor for a variety of diseases such as diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases. Restricting energy intake, or caloric restriction (CR), can reduce body weight and improve metabolic parameters in overweight or obese patients. We previously found that Lingguizhugan decoction (LZD) in combination with CR can effectively lower plasma lipid levels in patients with metabolic syndrome. However, the mechanism underlying CR and LZD treatment is still unclear. AIM: To investigate whether CR and LZD improve metabolic parameters by modulating gut microbiota. METHODS: We extracted the water-soluble components out of raw materials and dried as LZD extracts. Eight-week old male C57BL/6 mice were treated with a 3-d treatment regime that included 24 h-fasting followed by gavage of LZD extracts for 2 consecutive days, followed by a normal diet (ND) ad libitum for 16 wk. To test the effects of gut microbiota on diet-induced obesity, 8-wk old male C57BL/6 mice received fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from CR and LZD-treated mice every 3 d and were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) ad libitum for 16 wk. Control mice received either saline gavage or FMT from ND-fed mice receiving saline gavage as mentioned above. Body weight was monitored bi-weekly. Food consumption of each cage hosting five mice was recorded weekly. To monitor blood glucose, total cholesterol, and total triglycerides, blood samples were collected via submandibular bleeding after 6 h fasting. Oxygen consumption rate was monitored with metabolic cages. Feces were collected, and fecal DNA was extracted. Profiles of gut microbiota were mapped by metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: We found that CR and LZD treatment significantly reduced the body weight of mice fed with ND (28.71 +/- 0.29 vs 28.05 +/- 0.15, P < 0.05), but did not affect plasma total cholesterol or total triglyceride levels. We then transplanted the fecal microbiota collected from CR and LZD-treated mice under ND feeding to HFD-fed mice. Intriguingly, transplanting the mice with fecal microbiota from CR and LZD-treated mice potently reduced body weight (44.95 +/- 1.02 vs 40.53 +/- 0.97, P < 0.001). FMT also reduced HFD-induced hepatosteatosis, in addition to improved glycemic control. Mechanistic studies found that FMT increased OCR of the mice and suppressed the expression and protein abundance of lipogenic genes in the liver. Metagenomic analysis revealed that HFD drastically altered the profile of gut microbiota, and FMT modified the profile of the gut microbiota. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that CR and LZD improve metabolic parameters by modulating gut microbiota.

35347962|t|[Metabonomic study of biochemical changes in serum of PCPA-induced insomnia rats after treatment with Suanzaoren Decoction].
35347962|a|Suanzaoren Decoction(SZRD) is a classical formula for the clinical treatment of insomnia. This study analyzed the effect of SZRD on endogenous metabolites in insomnia rats based on metabonomics and thereby explored the anti-insomnia mechanism of SZRD. To be specific, DL-4-chlorophenylalanine(PCPA) was used to induce insomnia in rats. Then pathological changes of the liver and brain were observed and biochemical indexes such as 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT), dopamine(DA), glutamate(Glu), gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA), and norepinephrine(NE) in the hippocampus and prostaglandin D2(PGD2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta), and IL-6 in the serum of rats were detected. On this basis, the effect of SZRD on PCPA-induced insomnia rats was preliminarily assessed. The metabolic profile of rat serum samples was further analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). Principal component analysis(PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA) were combined with t-test and variable importance in projection(VIP) to identify differential metabolites, and MetaboAnalyst 5.0 was employed for pathway analysis. The results showed that SZRD could improve the pathological changes of brain and liver tissues, increase the levels of neurotransmitters 5-HT, DA, and GABA in hippocampus and the level of PGD2 in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis(HPA axis), and reduce the levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in serum of insomnia rats. Metabonomics analysis yielded 12 significantly changed potential metabolites: 5-aminovaleric acid, N-acetylvaline, L-proline, L-glutamate, L-valine, DL-norvaline, D(-)-arginine, pyroglutamic acid, 1-methylguanine, L-isoleucine, 7-ethoxy-4-methylcoumarin, and phthalic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester(MEHP), which were related with multiple biochemical processes including metabolism of D-glutamine and D-glutamate, metabolism of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate, metabolism of arginine and proline, arginine biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism. These metabolic changes indicated that SZRD can improve the metabolism in insomnia rats by regulating amino acid metabolism.

11090993|t|Protective effect of Oren-gedoku-to (Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang) against impairment of learning and memory induced by transient cerebral ischemia in mice.
11090993|a|The protective effect of Oren-gedoku-to (OGT; Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang), a traditional Chinese medicine, against impairment of learning and memory induced by transient cerebral ischemia was investigated in mice. The cerebral ischemia caused a reduction of step-down latency and an increase of step-down errors in the passive avoidance task. Pretreatment with oral administration of OGT (2, 4 or 8 g of herbs per kg) once daily for 5 days prolonged the step-down latency significantly and decreased the step-down errors as compared with those of sham-operated controls. In the Morris water maze test, the cerebral ischemia caused an increase in the latency until finding the platform in the training trial and a decrease in the percentage of swimming in the quadrant of the former platform in the probe trial. Oren-gedoku-to (OGT; 2, 4 and 8 g/kg, p. o.) shortened the latency of escaping markedly onto the platform in the training trial and increased the percentage of crossing the former platform quadrant in the probe trial. A reference drug, tacrine (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, p.o.), prevented the reduction of step-down latency in the passive avoidance task and shortened the escape latency in the Morris water maze task. Furthermore, OGT significantly protected against cerebral ischemia-induced reduction in the acetylcholine (ACh) content of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. These results indicate that the protective effects of OGT against the impairment of learning and memory induced by transient cerebral ischemia may be associated with preventing the decrease in the ACh content of the mouse brain.

15768870|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the intervention of liuwei dihuang pill (LDP) on therapeutic effectiveness and adverse reaction of hormonotherapy in treating nephrotic syndrome. METHODS: Patients allocated in two groups were medicated with initial dose of prednisone 1 mg/kg once a day at 8 am in the morning. After being medicated for 8 to 12 weeks, the dose of prednisone was decreased by 5.0 mg every 2 weeks till 0.5 mg/kg per day. Then the medication was changed to that two days' dosage orally take once a day with the daily dose reduced by 5.0 mg/kg every 2 to 3 weeks, and maintained at 0.4 mg/kg once every two days. At same time, necessary symptomatic treatment was given. To the treated group oral administration of LDP 8 capsules was given additionally, 3 times per day until prednisone decreased to maintenance dose. RESULTS: Therapeutic effect in the treated group was significant better than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Urinary protein, plasma albumin, triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in both groups were obviously improved (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). However, as compared with the control group, the improvement was better, and the recurrent rate was lower (P < 0.05) in the treated group. Scores of Yin-deficiency caused excessive Fire syndrome and incidence rate of adverse reaction in the treated group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: LDP can markedly improve the therapeutic effectiveness and counteract the adverse reaction of hormonotherapy in treating nephrotic syndrome, and reduce the recurrence of the disease.

21810459|t|Liu-He-Tang inhibited plaque formation by human respiratory syncytial virus infection in cell lines of the human respiratory tract.
21810459|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Liu-He-Tang (LHT) has been used to treat adult respiratory tract infection with productive cough and fever for a thousand years in ancient China. Adults with respiratory tract infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) can have symptoms similar to those managed by LHT. Therefore, LHT is supposed to be beneficial for adult HRSV infection. However, LHT does not have any antiviral activity to support its use against HRSV infection. AIM OF THE STUDY: HRSV is the most important virus causing serious pediatric respiratory tract infections worldwide. HRSV also contributes considerably to respiratory tract illness in adults. There is no effective therapeutic modality against HRSV infection. In order to find readily available agents to manage adult HRSV infection, this study tested the hypothesis that LHT has antiviral activity against HRSV-induced cytopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effect of the hot water extract of LHT on HRSV was tested by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines and also a human normal fibroblast cell line (WI-38). Ability of LHT to stimulate anti-viral cytokines was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: LHT could dose-dependently inhibit HRSV-induced plaque formation (p < 0.0001), especially in A549 cell. 300 mug/ml LHT nearly abolished plaque formation in A549 cells. LHT was more effective when given before viral inoculation (p < 0.0001). LHT dose-dependently inhibited viral attachment (p < 0.0001). Besides, LHT could inhibit HRSV internalization both time-dependently and dose-dependently (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, LHT stimulated epithelial cells to secrete IFN-beta and TNF-alpha to counteract HRSV infection before infection becomes established. CONCLUSIONS: LHT has anti-HRSV activity that provides a basic support of its possible use in managing adult HRSV infection.

26629011|t|Therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of Zhenrenyangzang decoction in rats with experimental ulcerative colitis.
26629011|a|Zhenrenyangzang Decoction (ZD) has been used as a classic formula in China for the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction such as chronic gastritis. However, there is less study on its application in ulcerative colitis (UC) and the effects are not yet clearly defined. To explore the effectiveness of ZD in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced UC rats, ZD was administered orally for 8 days at a dosage of 2, 4 or 8 g/kg/day. Following drug administration, the disease activity index (DAI) and tissue damage scores were recorded. In addition, mRNA and protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in colon tissues were examined by real time PCR and western blotting assay. As compared with the UC model group, ZD promoted the recovery of colitis and inhibited the colonic inflammation damage in UC rats by reducing the mRNA or protein expression of NF-kappaB and p38MAPK, as well as activating the production of TLR2 in colon tissues. And ZD significantly reduced the DAI and tissue damage scores. The therapeutic effect of ZD was found to be comparable to that of SASP. Our results suggested that ZD could improve colonic mucosa impairment and possesses favorable therapeutic action in TNBS-induced colitis, which provides direct pharmacological evidence for its clinical application.

12799501|t|[Effects of Bakumondo-to (Mai-Men-Dong-Tang) on cough sensitivity to capsaicin in asthmatic patients with cough hypersensitivity].
12799501|a|UNLABELLED: Some patients with bronchial asthma have increased cough sensitivity. In such patients coughing may be an inducer of wheeze. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Bakumondo-to on the cough sensitivity and respiratory tract inflammation in asthmatic patients with increased cough sensitivity. In addition influences of intensity of respiratory tract inflammation, gender, type of asthma, and disease period on the effect of Bakumondo-to on the cough sensitivity were examined. Twenty-one bronchial asthmatics whose cough thresholds to capsaicin were less than 3.9 microM were examined. METHODS: Cough thresholds to capsaicin (concentration of inhaled capsaicin solution causing 5 or more coughs) was measured before and after 2 months or more treatment with Bakumondo-to (9 g/day, TJ-29). Number of eosinophils in peripheral blood, sputum eosinophil ratio, and ECP level in the serum were also measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: Bakumondo-to significantly increased the cough threshold. Although respiratory tract inflammation was not significantly improved, number of eosinophils in peripheral blood, sputum eosinophil ratio and ECP level in the serum were remarkably decreased more than the half. And Bakumondo-to was more effective in asthmatic subjects with severe airway inflammation. Furthermore, a greater effect of it was observed in women. A greater effect was also observed in patients having a disease duration of less than 1 year. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Bakumondo-to may be an effective therapeutic preparation for coughing in asthmatic patients with cough hypersensitivity.

31885639|t|Yu Ping Feng San Exert Anti-Angiogenesis Effects through the Inhibition of TSLP-STAT3 Signaling Pathways in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
31885639|a|BACKGROUND: Clinically, Yu ping feng san (YPFS) has been extensively used as a medication for treating immune deficiency, and YPFS is combined with chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Previous research has shown that YPFS has a therapeutic effect on HCC by improving the immunosuppressive state of the liver cancer microenvironment. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of YPFS on angiogenesis of HCC. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to certify the composition of YPFS. An orthotopic transplanted model of murine HCC was entrenched. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the changes of the microvessel density (MVD). The MTT assay was used to detect the cell viability. ELISA was performed to analyze the expression of related factors. Western blot was used to analyze the protein expression. Tube formation assay was used to analyze the anti-angiogenic efficiency. RESULTS: YPFS significantly reduced the tumor volume and weight, thus exerted the growth inhibitory effect. The level of MVD and VEGF was obviously decreased in YPFS-treated HCC-bearing mice, and the YPFS treatment also reduced the VEGF level in Hepa1-6 cells. Further study revealed that the expression of TSLP/TSLPR and p-STAT3/STAT3 was decreased by YPFS. The level of MVD and VEGF and the expression of TSLP/TSLPR and p-STAT3/STAT3 in tumor tissue and Hepa1-6 cells were suppressed by incubation with the anti-TSLP antibody, whereas treatment with the anti-TSLP antibody in YPFS-treated cells did not cause further significant inhibition compared with the cells treated only with YPFS. More importantly, YPFS inhibited proliferation, expression of p-STAT3/STAT3, and tube formation of HUVECs induced by TSLP. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that YPFS attenuated the activation of the TSLP-STAT3 signaling pathway by inhibiting the immune-related factor-TSLP, thereby inhibiting the formation of hepatic microvessels and exerting an anti-HCC effect.

35477576|t|Angong Niuhuang Wan reduces hemorrhagic transformation and mortality in ischemic stroke rats with delayed thrombolysis: involvement of peroxynitrite-mediated MMP-9 activation.
35477576|a|BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a common complication of delayed tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) treatment for ischemic stroke. Peroxynitrite plays an important role in the breakdown of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the development of HT. We tested the hypothesis that Angong Niuhuang Wan (AGNHW), a traditional Chinese medicinal formula, could be used in conjunction with t-PA to protect the BBB, minimize HT, and improve neurological function by suppressing peroxynitrite-mediated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activation. METHODS: We first performed quality control study and chemical identification of AGNHW by using UPLC. In animal experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 5 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 19 h of reperfusion plus t-PA infusion (10 mg/kg) at 5 h of cerebral ischemia. AGNHW (257 mg/kg) was given orally at 2 h after MCAO. Hemorrhagic transformation was measured using hemorrhagic scores and hemoglobin levels in ischemic brains. Evans blue leakage was utilized to assess the severity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage. The modified neurologic severity score (mNSS) test was used to assess neurological functions. Peroxynitrite and superoxide was detected by using fluorescent probes. MMP-9 activity and expression were examined by gelatin zymography and immunostaining. The antioxidant effects were also studied by using brain microvascular endothelial b.End3 cells exposed to 5 h of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) plus 5 h of reoxygenation with t-PA treatment (20 microg/ml). RESULTS: AGNHW significantly reduced the BBB damage, brain edema, reduced hemorrhagic transformation, enhanced neurological function, and reduced mortality rate in the ischemic stroke rats with t-PA treatment. AGNHW reduced peroxynitrite and superoxide in vivo and in vitro and six active chemical compounds were identified from AGNHW with peroxynitrite scavenging activity. Furthermore, AGNHW inhibited MMP-9 activity, and preserved tight junction protein claudin-5 and collagen IV in the ischemic brains. CONCLUSION: AGNHW could be a potential adjuvant therapy with t-PA to protect the BBB integrity, reduce HT, and improve therapeutic outcome in ischemic stroke treatment via inhibiting peroxynitrite-mediated MMP-9 activation.

31666500|t|Systematic Pharmacological Methodology to Explore the Pharmacological Mechanism of Siwu Decoction for Osteoporosis.
31666500|a|Osteoporosis is an important health problem worldwide. Siwu decoction (SWD) and its modification have a good clinical effect on osteoporosis. However, the molecular mechanism of SWD on osteoporosis has not been thoroughly explained. A systematic pharmacological methodology was utilized to predict the active compounds and potential targets of SWD, collect the genes of osteoporosis and the known targets of SWD, and analyze the osteoporosis and SWD's network. Five networks were constructed and analyzed: (1) Osteoporosis genes' protein-protein interaction (PPI) network; (2) Compound-compound target network of SWD; (3) SWD-osteoporosis PPI network; (4) Compound-known target network of SWD; and (5) SWD known target- osteoporosis PPI network. Several osteoporosis and treatment-related targets (eg.,. HSP90AB1, FGFR1, HRAS, GRB2, and PGF), clusters, biological processes, and signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and FoxO signaling pathway) were found. The therapeutic effect of SWD on osteoporosis may be achieved by interfering with the biological processes and signaling pathways related to the development of osteoporosis.

30643399|t|Reduction in exacerbation of COPD in patients of advanced age using the Japanese Kampo medicine Dai-kenchu-to: a retrospective cohort study.
30643399|a|PURPOSE: Patients with symptomatic COPD are recommended to use inhaled bronchodilators containing long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs). However, bronchodilators may cause gastrointestinal adverse effects due to anticholinergic reactions, especially in advanced-age patients with COPD. Dai-kenchu-to (TU-100, Da Jian Zhong Tang in Chinese) is the most frequently prescribed Japanese herbal Kampo medicine and is often prescribed to control abdominal bloating and constipation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of Dai-kenchu-to as a supportive therapy in advanced-age patients with COPD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination inpatient database and identified patients aged >/=75 years who were hospitalized for COPD exacerbation. We then compared the risk of re-hospitalization for COPD exacerbation or death between patients with and without Dai-kenchu-to using 1-to-4 propensity score matching. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the two groups. We performed subgroup analyses for patients with and without LAMA therapy. RESULTS: Patients treated with Dai-kenchu-to had a significantly lower risk of re-hospitalization or death after discharge; the HR was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.67-0.99) in 1-to-4 propensity score matching. Subgroup analysis of LAMA users showed a significant difference in re-hospitalization or death, while subgroup analysis of LAMA non-users showed no significant difference. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that Dai-kenchu-to may have improved the tolerability of LAMA in advanced-age patients with COPD and, therefore, reduced the risk of re-hospitalization or death from COPD exacerbation. Dai-kenchu-to may be recommended as a useful supportive therapy for advanced-age patients with COPD.

27114059|t|Protective effects of DJ-1 medicated Akt phosphorylation on mitochondrial function are promoted by Da-Bu-Yin-Wan in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-treated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.
27114059|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Da-Bu-Yin-Wan (DBYW), a historically traditional Chinese medicine formula, was originally defined over 600 years ago. In recent decades, DBYW was clinically employed to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the underlying mechanism of DBYW on mitochondrial function, we investigated the effect of DBYW on mitochondrial function from the perspectives of DJ-1 and Akt signaling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human derived neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid pcDNA3-Flag-DJ-1 aimed to overexpress the DJ-1 protein. Transfected cells were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), a PD-related mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, in the absence and presence of DBYW. The cell viability was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The protein expressions of DJ-1 and Akt signaling were examined by western blotting. The mitochondrial mass was evaluated by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The mitochondrial complex I activity and cellular ATP content were measured by commercial kits. RESULTS: Transfection with pcDNA3-Flag-DJ-1 decreased the MPP(+)-induced toxicity and overexpressed the DJ-1. In DJ-1 overexpressed cells, the mitochondrial mass was raised, mitochondrial complex I activity was improved, and cellular ATP content was increased. In addition, overexpression of DJ-1 augmented the Akt phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473. Moreover, DBYW promoted the above effects in DJ-1 expressed cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that DJ-1 protects the mitochondrial function by medicating Akt phosphorylation in MPP(+)-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, DBYW enhances the protective effect of DJ-1 medicated Akt phosphorylation on mitochondrial function.

26539405|t|Pilot study of the use of Yin Qiao San in children with conventional antipyretic hypersensitivity.
26539405|a|BACKGROUND: Children with a diagnosis of cross-reactive hypersensitivity to both paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are limited in their choice of antipyretics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a Chinese proprietary medicine, Yin Qiao San (YQS), for fever relief. METHODS: A single centre, open label, prospective clinical trial exploring the tolerability and feasibility of using YQS for fever relief in children who are unable to use conventional antipyretic medications. Children between 1-18 years of age with hypersensitivity to multiple antipyretics were recruited. Eligible participants underwent an oral provocation test with YQS. Children who passed the oral provocation test were instructed to take a prescribed dose of YQS when the temperature was >38.0 and continued till the fever settled. Time taken for fever resolution and any adverse events were collected. RESULTS: A total of 21 children, mean age 10.7 years, had a diagnosis of paracetamol and ibuprofen hypersensitivity. All except one patient successfully tolerated an oral challenge of YQS. Of the 88 doses of YQS taken for fever over 38.0, 16 (18%) had documented temperature reduction 2 hours after ingestion and 30 (34%) had documented temperature reduction 4 hours after ingestion. There were 2 reports of urticaria after YQS use which were attributed to flare of recurrent spontaneous urticaria during the illness. None of the patients developed symptoms of circulatory compromise or respiratory distress. CONCLUSION: YQS is generally well tolerated in patients with paracetamol and ibuprofen hypersensitivity.

17608229|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Suanzao nacute hepatic failure in mice. METHOD: Acute liver failure was induced in male Kunming strain mice by enterocoelia injecting the animals with D-Gal-N and LPS. The mice in treatment groups were given corresponding drug 2 h before administration of D-Ga1-N and LPS, and the mice in control group were given the same dose of distilled water. The 24 h survival rate, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were compared. Serum the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 and the levels of SOD, MDA, GR, GSH, NO and NOS in the liver were determined. RESULT: Treatment with suanzaoren decoction could increase the survival rate and improve the liver histological feather. Suanzaoren decoction inhibited the serum the levels of ALT, AST, TNF-alpha and IL-1, and reduced the levels of MDA, NO and NOS and increased the levels of GR and SOD in the liver. CONCLUSION: Treatment with Suanzaoren decoction can suppress the D-Gal-N/LPS-induced acute hepatic failure. It may be the mechanism that Suanzaoren decocotion regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines and free radicals.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We selected chemical constituents and targets of THSWT according to TCMSP and UniProtKB databases and collected therapeutic targets on EH from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Drugbank and DisGeNET databases. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) was analyzed by using String database. Then network was constructed by using Cytoscape_v3.7.1, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment was performed by using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software. RESULTS The results of our network pharmacology research showed that the THSWT, composed of 6 Chinese herbs, contained 15 compounds, and 23 genes regulated the main signaling pathways related to EH. Moreover, the PPI network based on targets of THSWT on EH revealed the interaction relationship between targets. These core compounds were 6 of the 15 disease-related compounds in the network, kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin, Myricanone, beta-sitosterol, baicalein, and the core genes contained ADRB2, CALM1, HMOX1, JUN, PPARG, and VEGFA, which were regulated by more than 3 compounds and significantly associated with Calcium signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, and Ras signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS This network pharmacological study can reveal potential mechanisms of multi-target and multi-component THSWT in the treatment of EH, provide a scientific basis for studying the mechanism.

25214959|t|Effect of Zhenwu Tang Granule on pressure-overloaded left ventricular myocardial hypertrophy in rats.
25214959|a|BACKGROUND: In the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, few studies have focused on the compound preparations though there are many investigations. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of Zhenwu Tang Granule on chronic pressure-overloaded left ventricular hypertrophy in rats. METHODS: The study was performed at the laboratory of Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease. Male SD rats were divided randomly into 3 groups: sham operation group (n=8), operation group (n=15) and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) group (n=15). The model of myocardial hypertrophy was made by gradually constricting the abdominal aorta. Sixteen weeks later, cardiac ultrasonography was performed in all groups in order to ascertain post-operational left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. And Zhenwu Tang Granule was added at a dose of 12 g/kg in the mixed feedstuff for 8 weeks in the TCM group. In the 24th week, weight, structure as well as function of the heart in each group were measured by high-frequency ultrasonography, and Masson's staining was performed on the cardiac muscles. Meanwhile, total collagen volume fraction (CVF-T) and non-coronary vessel collagen volume fraction (CVF-NV) were analyzed. RESULTS: There was an increase in the weight of the heart in the operation group, with the left ventricule dominated (P<0.05). The heart was enlarged, with diastolic interventricular septal distance (IVSd) and left ventricular posterior wall distance (LVPWd) dominated (P<0.01). There was a significant decrease in the cardiac function (P<0.05). The weight (P<0.01) and volume of the heart decreased in the TCM group compared with the operation group, with IVSd and systolic left ventricular posterior wall dominated (P<0.01). And the cardiac function was improved (P<0.05). Significant interstitial and collagen hyperplasia was shown in the operation group based on pathological analysis, and various improvements were proved in the TCM group, i.e. there was a significant decrease in CVF-T and CVF-NV (P<0.01) compared with the operation group; but no difference (P>0.05) was found when compared with the pseudo-operation group. CONCLUSION: Zhenwu Tang Granule could reduce the weight and volume of the heart, improve the cardiac function, inhibit hyperplasia of collagen, and reverse myocardial hypertrophy in rats with pressure-overloaded left ventricular hypertrophy.

27196295|t|Huangqi decoction alleviates dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver fibrosis: An analysis of bile acids metabolic mechanism.
27196295|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huangqi Decoction (HQD), a classical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, is used to treating liver injury in China. The aim of the study is to investigate mechanisms of HQD against dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver fibrosis underlying metabolic profiles of bile acids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DMN-induced liver fibrosis rats were administrated HQD and its compounds, astragalosides (AS), glycyrrhizic acid (GA) and their combination. The anti-fibrosis effects were evaluated and targeted metabolomics by UPLC-MS was used to examine whether HQD had an influence on bile acid metabolism. The levels of mRNAs associated with bile acid metabolism were expressed by RT-PCR. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)-induced hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) proliferation and activation were examined using MTS assay and Western blot. RESULTS: Histopathological changes and serum liver function in HQD group had significant improvements (P<0.01). Concentrations of free bile acids and taurine conjugates were significantly increased in DMN group (P<0.05). HQD and its compounds restored the increased bile acids to normal levels, and HQD was more effected on parts of bile acids. Furthermore, the levels of mRNAs related bile acid synthesis and reabsorption such as CYP7A1, CYP8B1, CYP27A1, OATP2, OATP3, OATP4 and NTCP were significantly down-regulated in DMN group (P<0.05), mRNAs related excretion such as MRP3 and BESP were up-regulated (P<0.01), and CYP7A1, CYP8B1, OATP3, OATP4, NTCP and MRP3 restored to normal levels by HQD treatment. Moreover, CDCA-induced HSCs proliferation and activation were weaken by HQD (P<0.05) with down-regulated alpha-SMA, TGF-beta1, p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 expressions. CONCLUSIONS: HQD alleviated DMN-induced liver fibrosis with a better effect than its compounds, which may be involved in the regulation of bile acid metabolism enzyme. Moreover, HQD may inhibit CDCA-induced HSCs proliferation and activation.
27196295|k|CONCLUSIONS: HQD alleviated DMN-induced liver fibrosis with a better effect than its compounds, which may be involved in the regulation of bile acid metabolism enzyme.

35378415|t|Fuzi decoction ameliorates pain and cartilage degeneration of osteoarthritic rats through PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and its clinical retrospective evidence.
35378415|a|BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a difficult disease but the clinic lacks effective therapy. As a classic formula of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Fuzi decoction (FZD) has been clinically applied for treating OA-related syndromes, but its anti-OA efficacy and mechanism remain unclear. PURPOSE: To experimentally and clinically determine the anti-OA efficacy of FZD and clarify the underlying mechanism. METHODS: UPLC/MS/MS was applied to identify the main components of FZD. A monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA rat model was employed to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of FZD against OA, by using pain behavior assessment, histopathological observation, and immunohistochemical analysis. Primary rat chondrocytes were isolated to determine the in vitro effects of FZD by using cell viability assay, wound healing assay, and real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis on anabolic/catabolic mRNA expressions. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and network pharmacology analysis were conducted and the overlapping data were used to predict the mechanism of FZD, followed by verification with qPCR and Western blot assays. Finally, a retrospective analysis was performed to confirm FZD's efficacy and safety in OA patients. RESULTS: The UPLC/MS/MS result showed that FZD contained atractylenolide I, benzoylhypaconitine, benzoylmesaconitine, benzoylaconitine, hypaconitine, mesaconitine, aconitine, lobetyolin, paeoniflorin, and pachymic acid. The in vivo data showed that FZD restored the cartilage degeneration in MIA-induced OA rats by ameliorating pain behavior parameters, recovering histopathological alterations, benefitting cartilage anabolism (up-regulating Col2 expression), and suppressing catabolism (down-regulating MMP13 and Col10 expressions). The in vitro data showed that FZD increased cell viability and wound healing capacity of chondrocytes, and restored the altered expressions of anabolic and catabolic genes of chondrocytes. The overlapping results of RNA-seq and network pharmacology analysis suggested that PI3K/Akt signaling mediated the anti-OA mechanism of FZD, which was verified by qPCR and Western blot experiments. Clinically, the anti-OA efficacy and safety of FZD were confirmed by the retrospective analysis on OA patients. CONCLUSION: The scientific innovation of this study was the determination of anti-OA efficacy of FZD by experimental and clinical evidence and the discovery of its mechanism by integrated RNA-seq, network pharmacology, and molecular experiments, which suggests FZD as a promising TCM agency for OA treatment.

7783463|t|Effects of chai ling tang on proteinuria in rat models.
7783463|a|Effects of Chai Ling Tang (a decoction of medicinal herbs) on passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) in rats, a model similar to human membranous nephropathy, were examined. Four hundred mg/kg (body weight) of Chai Ling Tang, or 240 mg/kg B.W. of Xiao Chai Hu Tang, or 130 mg/kg B.W. of Chai Hu (Radix Bupleuri), Ban Xia (Rhizoma Pinelliae) and Sheng Jiang (Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens) were intraperitoneally injected respectively into three groups of female Wistar rats once a day starting from 5 days before intravenous injection of anti-FxlA antibody to the end of the experiment. Another group of rats intraperitoneally injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as the control. It was found that the excretion of urinary protein was significantly suppressed in the Chai Ling Tang treated group (52.2 +/- 46.9 mg/day) as compared to that in the PBS control group (276.5 +/- 127.0 mg/day) 15 days after anti-FxlA antibody injection (P < 0.01). The decrease of serum albumin and total protein, and the increase of serum total cholesterol were significantly inhibited in the Chai Ling Tang treated group as compared to that in the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively). It is therefore concluded that proteinuria in PHN can be significantly suppressed by Chai Ling Tang.

30050591|t|The Effect and Mechanism of Chinese Herbal Formula Sini Tang in Heart Failure after Myocardial Infarction in Rats.
30050591|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and mechanism of the Chinese herbal formula Sini Tang (SNT) which consists of Aconitum carmichaelii (Fuzi), Zingiber officinale (Gan Jiang), and Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Gancao) in heart failure after myocardial infarction in rats. METHODS: We established the heart failure after myocardial infarction in model of SD rats by ligating the anterior descending branch of left coronary artery. Rats were randomly divided into six experimental groups: Sham operation group, HF group, Benazepril group, high dose of SNT group, medium dose of SNT group, and low dose of SNT group. Drugs were administered by oral gavage for eight weeks. The detection indexes include left ventricular function by echocardiogram, Collagen Volume Fraction by Masson staining, level of Plasma Renin, Angiotensin II and Aldosterone by radioimmunoassay, protein and gene level of ACE and AT1R by western-blot, and real-time PCR. RESULTS: The outcomes of this study indicated that SNT significantly improved the LVEF and LVFS, thickened both LVAWd and LVAWs, and reduced LVIDs in heart failure after myocardial infarction in rats when compared with control group (P < 0.05). Besides, SNT significantly reduced the Collagen Volume Fraction (P < 0.05). The results of radioimmunoassay showed that SNT decreased the level of Plasma Renin, Angiotensin II, and Aldosterone (P < 0.05). The outcomes of western-blot and real-time PCR analysis showed that SNT significantly downregulated the protein and gene level of ACE and AT1R (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese herbal formula SNT could improve left ventricular systolic function in heart failure after myocardial infarction in rats and decreased the level of Plasma Renin, Angiotensin II, and Aldosterone, as well as downregulating the protein and gene level of ACE and AT1R. Therefore, SNT has potential benefits of improving cardiac function by inhibiting the excessive activation of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system in heart failure after myocardial infarction in rats.

21784143|t|Deciphering the neuroprotective mechanisms of Bu-yang Huan-wu decoction by an integrative neurofunctional and genomic approach in ischemic stroke mice.
21784143|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bu-yang Huan-wu decoction (BHD) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine formula that has been used clinically in Asia to treat stroke-induced disability for centuries, but the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms are not fully understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we aim to investigate the mechanisms of action using an integrative neurofunctional and broad genomics approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male ICR mice were subjected to an acute ischemic stroke by inducing a middle cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (CI/R) injury. To examine whether BHD could extend the lifespan of mice with a stroke, we used oral administration of BHD (0.5 and 1.0g/kg) twice daily starting from 2h after ischemia and compared this with vehicle control treatments, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA, 10mg/kg, i.v.), and MK-801 (0.2mg/kg, i.p.). An integrative neurofunctional and genomic approach was performed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of BHD. RESULTS: More than 80% of the mice died within 2 days after stroke induction in the vehicle control treatment group. However, the survival rates and life-spans of mice treated with BHD, rt-PA and MK-801 were significantly enhanced as compared to the vehicle-treated CI/R group in all three cases. Mice treated with BHD (1.0g/kg) showed the greatest protective effect across all groups. BHD successfully restored brain function, ameliorated the cerebral infarction, and significantly improved the neurological deficits of the mice with a stroke. BHD also reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, as well as improved neurogenesis. The molecular impacts of BHD were assessed by genome-wide transcriptome analysis using brains from the CI/R mice. The results showed a total of 377 ischemia-induced probe-sets that were significantly influenced by BHD including 93 probe-sets that were commonly more abundant in BHD-treated and sham mice, and another 284 ischemia-induced probe sets that were suppressed by BHD. Mining the functional modules and genetic networks of these 377 genes revealed a significant upregulation of neuroprotective genes associated with neurogenesis (6 genes) and nervous system development (9 genes), and a significant down-regulation of destructive genes associated with the induction of inflammation (14 genes), apoptosis (15 genes), angiogenesis (11 genes) and blood coagulation (7 genes) by BHD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that BHD is able to protect mice against stroke and extend lifespan primarily through a significant down-regulation of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and blood coagulation, as well as an up-regulation of genes mediating neurogenesis and nervous system development. The changes in expression after treatment with BHD are beneficial after ischemic stroke.

29957466|a|Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complications in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Zuogui pill as a traditional Chinese herbal drug has been used for nourish kidney essence improve bone malnutrition of renal bone disease by regulating the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus and participating in osteoblast metabolism. In the present study, 5/6 nephrectomy rat model was used to reveal the mechanism of zuogui pill in treatment of CKD-MBD. Compared with sham rats, the levels of serum phosphorus, PTH, iPTH and creatinine were significantly decreased, while the serum calcium level was significantly increased, and the Cbfa1 protein level was significantly decreased and FGF23 protein level was significantly increased by Zuogui pill treatment. Compared with model rats, the BMD of rat was significantly increased by Zuogui pill treatment. Histological analysis revealed that the kidney injury of rats with CKD was significantly reduced by zuogui pill treatment. Compared with model rats, the CYP27B1 mRNA level was significantly increased, and the PTH mRNA level and NaPiIIa protein level were significantly decreased in the kidney by zuogui pill treatment. We inferred that zuogui pill exhibited potential therapeutic effects on CKD-MBD in the rats by regulating bone metabolism and nourish kidney.

27106785|t|You-Gui pills promote nerve regeneration by regulating netrin1, DCC and Rho family GTPases RhoA, Racl, Cdc42 in C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
27106785|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: You-Gui pills (YGPs) are an effective traditional Chinese formula being used clinically for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Previous studies demonstrated that YGPs exerted the potent neuroprotective effects in murine models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is an equivalent animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the mechanism of YGPs functions remained unclear. AIM OF THIS STUDY: The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of YGPs in MOG35-55-induced EAE mice and to further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: Female C57BL/6 mice were divided into six groups, including the non-treated EAE model, prednisone acetate- and 1.2, 2.4 or 4.8g/kg YGPs-treated EAE groups, and a normal control group. The EAE model was established by injecting the mice subcutaneously with MOG35-55 antigen. The body weights were measured and the neurological functions were scored in each group. The pathology and morphology of the brain and spinal cord was examined. The expression of MAP-2 was detected by immunofluorescent staining. The levels of netrin1, DCC, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were assayed by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot on day 40 post-immunization (PI). RESULTS: YGPs treatments significantly reduced neurological function scores in EAE mice, where the inflammatory infiltration was reduced and the axon and myelin damage in both brain and spinal cord was alleviated. In the brain and spinal cord tissues, YGPs increased the expression of neuronal factors MAP-2, netrin1 and DCC. The expression of Rac1 and Cdc42 were increased, while RhoA was reduced following YGPs treatments. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that YGPs exhibited a neuroprotective effect on promoting nerve regeneration at the brain and spinal cord in EAE mice induced by MOG35-55. Netrin1, DCC and the Rho family GTPases of RhoA, Racl, Cdc42 were involved in mediating the effects of YGPs on nerve regeneration.

23627133|t|[Effect of banxia xiexin decoction on leptin and endothelin-1 of gastric ulcer rat and the optimal combination screening of active components].
23627133|a|OBJECTIVE: To select the optimal combination of five active component of Banxia Xiexin Decoction on gastric ulcer rat, and observe its effect on Leptin and ET-1. METHODS: Eighty-seven SD rats were randomly divided into normal group, sham-operated group and acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer group, omeprazole group as a positive control, five active components (glycyrrhetic acid, beta-sitosterol, berberine, baicalin and ginsenoside) of Banxia Xiexin Decoction were divided into groups by L16 orthogonal design. The ulcer area, and the content of Leptin and ET-1, and the mRNA expression level of both were detected. RESULTS: Among the sixteen orthogonal design groups, the ulcer area of these groups using both beta-sitosterol and berberine was the smallest (P < 0.05), the content of Leptin of these groups using both glycyrrhetic acid and ginsenoside was the highest in blood serum (P < 0.05), the group using glycyrrhetic acid had the minimum concentration of ET-1 in blood plasma. Compared with model group, berberine could raise the mRNA expression level of Leptin (P < 0.01), and beta-sitosterol could lower the mRNA expression level of ET-1 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of gastric ulcer may be related with the down-regulation of concentration and mRNA expression level of Leptin, and upregulation of concentration and mRNA expression level of ET-1, the active components in Banxia Xiexin Decoction may upregulated Leptin and inhibit ET-1 to accelerate the healing of gastric ulcer.

35189797|t|Network pharmacology research indicates that Wu-Mei-Wan treats obesity by inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation and alleviating metabolic inflammation.
35189797|a|BACKGROUND: Wu-Mei-Wan (WMW), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, has a good effect on the treatment of obesity and has been proven helpful to promote the metabolism of adipose tissue. However, its underlying mechanism remains to be studied. This study aims to explore the potential pharmacological mechanism of WMW in the treatment of obesity. METHODS: Network pharmacology was used to sort out the relationship between WMW putative targets and obesity-related drug targets or disease targets, which indicated the mechanism of WMW in treating obesity from two aspects of clinical drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and obesity-related diseases. Databases such as Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP), PubChem, DrugBank, DisGeNET, and Genecards were used to collect information about targets. String platform was used to convert the data into gene symbol of "homo sapiens", and perform gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. With the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) as background data, Cytoscape 3.6.0 software was used to construct a new protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Mechanism diagrams of key pathways were obtained from the KEGG database. AutoDock Vina software was used to conduct molecular docking verification. RESULTS: The number of targets in the overlap between WMW putative targets and obesity-related drug targets accounted for more than 50% of the latter, and HTR3A, SLC6A4, and CYP3A4 were core targets. In obesity-related disease targets-WMW putative targets PPI network, the Th17 cell differentiation pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway were key pathways, and the 1st module and the 7th module were central function modules that were highly associated with immunity and inflammation. Molecular docking verified that STAT3, TGFB1, MMP9, AHR, IL1B, and CCL2 were core targets in the treatment of WMW on obesity. CONCLUSION: WMW has similar effects on lipid and drug metabolism as the current obesity-related drugs, and is likely to treat obesity by inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation and alleviating metabolic inflammation.

35035511|t|Yijin-Tang Attenuates Cigarette Smoke and Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Mice.
35035511|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to a lung disorder associated with symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and sputum production. Traditionally, Yijin-tang (YJT), a mixture of Pinellia ternate, Poria cocos, ginger, Chinese liquorice, and tangerine peel, has been prescribed for the treatment of respiratory system diseases caused by dampness phlegm. This experiment investigated the therapeutic effect of YJT in a mouse model of cigarette smoke (CS)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced COPD. METHODS: COPD was induced by exposing mice to CS for 1 hour per day for 8 weeks, with intranasal delivery of LPS on weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7. YJT was administered at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg 1 hour before CS exposure for the last 4 weeks. RESULTS: YJT significantly suppressed CS- and LPS-induced increases in inflammatory cell counts and reduced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. In addition, YJT not only decreased airway wall thickness, average alveolar intercept, and lung fibrosis, but it also suppressed the expression of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-7, MMP-9, and transforming growth factor-B (TGF-beta) and collagen deposition. Moreover, YJT suppressed phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) as well as expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings show that YJT attenuates respiratory inflammation and airway remodeling caused by CS and LPS exposure; therefore, therapeutic applications in COPD can be considered.

33873073|t|Investigation of the therapeutic effect of Yinchen Wuling Powder on CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats by (1)H NMR and MS-based metabolomics analysis.
33873073|a|Hepatic fibrosis (HF) is a typical consequence of various chronic liver diseases, and there is still no ideal drug for its treatment. Yinchen Wuling Powder (YCWLP), a famous traditional Chinese medicine prescription, is effective for the treatment of icteric hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and other liver diseases in clinical practices, however, the underlying mechanisms of YCWLP on HF is still unclear. In this study, (1)H NMR and MS-based metabolomics analysis along with body weight change, serum liver function indexes, serum liver fibrosis index and histopathological observations of liver were applied to evaluate the therapeutic effect of YCWLP on hepatic fibrosis and the mechanism associated with this. The results of the pharmacodynamics study show that YCWLP has a significant therapeutic effect on hepatic fibrosis. As for the metabolomics research, 7 metabolites in the plasma samples, 28 in the urine samples and 6 in the liver samples were significantly altered due to the protective effect of YCWLP on CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis. These endogenous metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism and gut bacteria metabolism. These findings suggest that YCWLP could treat hepatic fibrosis by promoting urea circulation and reducing blood ammonia accumulation, improving carbohydrate metabolism and reducing oxidative stress, improving glycerophospholipid metabolism and protecting cell membrane, and regulating intestinal flora metabolism.

34457026|t|High-Throughput Sequencing Reveals the Differential MicroRNA Expression Profiles of Human Gastric Cancer SGC7901 Cell Xenograft Nude Mouse Models Treated with Traditional Chinese Medicine Si Jun Zi Tang Decoction.
34457026|a|Objective. The present study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism underlying the antitumor effect of Si Jun Zi Tang (SJZT) decoction on gastric cancer. Methods. Twelve human gastric cancer SGC7901 cell xenograft nude mouse models were established. The mice were randomly divided into the Model group and SJZT group. SJZT exerted significant antitumor effects after 21 days of decoction administration. High-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of tumor tissues. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to provide further information regarding the differentially expressed miRNAs. Five representative differentially expressed miRNAs and four predicted target genes were further validated using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Results. We identified 33 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the SJZT group compared with the Model group. Among them, 32 miRNAs were upregulated and 1 miRNA was downregulated. Bioinformatic analysis showed that most of miRNAs acted as tumor suppressors and their target genes participated in multiple signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, microRNAs in cancer, and Wnt signaling pathway. The qRT-PCR result confirmed that miR-223-3p, miR-205-5p, miR-147b-3p, and miR-223-5p were overexpressed and their respective paired target genes FUT9, POU2F1, MUC4, and RAB14 mRNA were obviously downregulated in the SJZT group compared with those in the Model group. Network analysis revealed that miR-223-3p and miR-205-5p shared two targets POU2F1 (encoding POU class 2 homeobox 1) and FUT9 (encoding fucosyltransferase 9), suggesting they have a common role in certain pathways. Conclusion. This study provided novel insights into the anticancer mechanism of SJZT against gastric cancer, which might be partly related to the modulation of miRNA expression and their target pathways in tumors.

26365787|t|Metabolic changes at the early stage of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture in rats and the interventional effects of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang.
26365787|a|Sepsis is a disease with high mortality that requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. This study used a metabolomic approach to profile the metabolic changes at the early stage of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in rats and investigated the interventional effects of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT). Male SD rats were intragastrically administered 270mg/kg HLJDT 2h prior to CLP, serum extracts were profiled by liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-Q-TOF-MS) and multivariate analytical (MVA) methods were employed to evaluate the metabolic changes of extracts. A Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) score plot indicated that septic rats undergo significant metabolic changes 2h after CLP, and HLJDT administration could reverse the metabolic changes induced by CLP. Sixteen biomarkers involved in amino acid metabolism, unsaturated fatty acid metabolism, purine metabolism, and lipid metabolism were identified after Orthogonal Partial Least-Squares Analysis (OPLS). Among the 16 metabolites, 10 were regulated by HLJDT. This study established the foundation for further research of the early diagnosis biomarkers and therapeutic evaluation biomarkers discovery of sepsis.

34672897|t|Erzhi pills ameliorate cognitive dysfunction and alter proteomic hippocampus profiles induced by d-galactose and Abeta1-40 injection in ovariectomized Alzheimer's disease model rats.
34672897|a|CONTEXT: Erzhi pills are a classic Chinese medicine prescription, but their effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not clear. OBJECTIVE: The protective effects of Erzhi pills in AD rats and their potential mechanisms were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An AD rat model was established by ovariectomy combined with d-galactose and Abeta1-40 injection. Rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham-operated, model, oestradiol valerate (0.80 mg/kg), Erzhi pills high-dose (1.50 g/kg), and Erzhi pills low-dose (0.75 g/kg). Learning and memory abilities were evaluated with the Morris water maze test, oestrogen levels with an ELISA kit, and hippocampal neuron morphology and Nissl bodies in the cytoplasm with H&E and Nissl staining. The expression of ERbeta, Abeta1-40, and p-tau(404) was determined by immunohistochemistry. Nano LC-LTQ-Orbitrap Proteomics determined potential targets and related signalling pathways. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of the related proteins. RESULTS: Erzhi pills (1.5, 0.75 g/kg) markedly reduced escape latencies on the MWM, increased numbers of platform crossings, numbers of neurons, Nissl bodies, oestrogen levels (100.18, 43.04 pg/mL), and ERbeta-positive cells (57.42, 39.83); Abeta1-40 (18.85, 36.83)- and p-tau(404) (14.42, 29.71)-positive cells were significantly decreased. Proteomics identified more than 100 differentially expressed proteins involved in 48 signalling pathways, five of which are involved in the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Western blotting showed decreased expression of GSK3beta and Bad, while Akt, PI3K, 14-3-3, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-2 were upregulated. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Erzhi pills may serve as a potential agent for AD therapeutics by improving learning and memory.

20473744|t|Research on the mechanism of Zuogui Pill and Yougui Pill in promoting axonal regeneration in model rats of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
20473744|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular mechanism of Zuogui Pill (ZGP) and Yougui Pill (YGP) on axonal regeneration in rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: EAE rat model was established by bilateral rear pedes subcutaneous injection of antigen made by mixing myelin basic protein (MBP) and complete Freud's adjuvant (CFA) in the volume ratio of 1:1. The pathological changes of axonal injury and regeneration in the brain and the spinal cord were observed on the 14th (the acute stage) and the 28th day (the remission stage) after modeling, with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, silver stain, and immunohistochemical staining. The rats treated with prednisone acetate were taken as controls. RESULTS: Observation under the light microscope with HE staining showed a sleeve-like change in rats' cerebrospinal parenchyma with inflammatory cell infiltration around the small vessels and neuronic denaturation, while silver staining showed excessive tumefaction and abscission of axon, and immunohistochemical analysis showed decreasing of nerve growth factor (NGF) expression at the acute stage of EAE, which was even more remarkable at the remission stage, showing significant difference as compared with the normal control (P<0.05). And the expressions of Nogo A, an axon growth inhibitor, and its receptor (Nogo-66 receptor, Ng R) were significantly higher than those in the normal control at the acute stage (P<0.01). However, after the intervention of ZGP and YGP, the pathological changes and axon damage in rats' brain and spinal cord were much more alleviated, and the NGF expression was significantly higher than that in the model group at the acute stage (P<0.05). The expression of NGF was even stronger during the remission stage, and a better effect was shown by YGP. As for Nogo A and Ng R expressions, they were significantly lower than those in the model group at the acute stage (P<0.05), but a better effect was shown by ZGP. CONCLUSIONS: ZGP and YGP can prevent axonal injury and promote the axonal regeneration in rats of EAE, and the possible mechanism is to increase the expression of NGF and reduce the expression of Nogo A and its receptor. However, some differences are observed between the two Chinese preparations in their acting times and points, which provides a certain basis for revealing the modern connotation of the Chinese medicine theory on tonifying Shen ()-yin and Shen-yang.

25700642|t|Inhibition of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 confers to tumor suppression by a herbal formulation Huanglian-Jiedu decoction in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
25700642|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: An oriental medicinal formulation, Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HLJDD), has been well documented in few Traditional Chinese Medicine Classics 1300 years ago for treatment of heat and dampness-related diseases. Its effect is well accepted in Asian community, including China, Japan and Korea. Recent studies have postulated HLJDD as a regimen for cancer treatment, especially liver cancer, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the suppressive effect of HLJDD on the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its possible underlying mechanism. METHODS: Chemical composition of HLJDD was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The tumor suppressive effect of HLJDD was determined on both HCC cells and xenograft model. Nascent protein synthesis was detected with Click-IT protein labeling technology; protein expression was determined by immunoblotting and imunnohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Quality analysis revealed that HLJDD of different batches is consistent in both chemical composition and bioactivities. HLJDD inhibited HCC cell proliferation at its non-toxic doses, and suppressed growth and angiogenesis in xenografted murine model. HLJDD suppressed the synthesis of nascent protein via inactivation of eEF2 without deregulating the translation initiation factors. The major components in HLJDD, geniposide, berberine and baicalin, additively act on eEF2, and contributed to the responsible activity. HLJDD-activated eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) led to eEF2 inactivation, and activation of AMPK signaling may be responsible for the eEF2K induction. Blocked AMPK activity in HLJDD-treated HCC cells attenuated eEF2K activation as well as the inhibitory effect of the formula. In nutrient deprived HCC cells with inactivated eEF2, the inhibitory effect of HLJDD in tumor cell expansion was interfered. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that HLJDD has potential in blocking HCC progression with involvement of eEF2 inhibition.

23935673|t|Renal Protective Role of Xiexin Decoction with Multiple Active Ingredients Involves Inhibition of Inflammation through Downregulation of the Nuclear Factor-kappaB Pathway in Diabetic Rats.
23935673|a|In Chinese medicine, Xiexin decoction (XXD) has been used for the clinical treatment of diabetes for at least 1700 years. The present study was conducted to investigate the effective ingredients of XXD and their molecular mechanisms of antidiabetic nephropathy in rats. Rats with diabetes induced by high-fat diet and streptozotocin were treated with XXD extract for 12 weeks. XXD significantly improved the glucolipid metabolism disorder, attenuated albuminuria and renal pathological changes, reduced renal advanced glycation end-products, inhibited receptor for advanced glycation end-product and inflammation factors expression, suppressed renal nuclear factor- kappa B pathway activity, and downregulated renal transforming growth factor- beta 1. The concentrations of multiple components in plasma from XXD were determined by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis using partial least square regression revealed that 8 ingredients of XXD were responsible for renal protective effects via actions on multiple molecular targets. Our study suggests that the renal protective role of XXD with multiple effective ingredients involves inhibition of inflammation through downregulation of the nuclear factor- kappa B pathway, reducing renal advanced glycation end-products and receptor for advanced glycation end-product in diabetic rats.

22520510|t|Inhibitory effect of Yukmijihwang-tang, a traditional herbal formula against testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.
22520510|a|BACKGROUND: Yukmijihwang-tang, a traditional herbal formula, has been used for treating disorder, diabetic mellitus and neurosis in China (Liu-wei-di-huang-tang in Chinese), Japan (Lokumijio-to in Japanese) and Korea for many years. In this study, we investigated the effects of Yukmijihwang-tang water extract (YJT) on the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) using a rat model of testosterone propionate (TP)-induced BPH. METHODS: A total of 30 rats were divided into five groups. One group was used as a control and the other groups received subcutaneous injections of TP for 4 weeks to induce BPH. YJT (200 or 400 mg/kg) was administered daily for 4 weeks to two groups by oral gavage concurrently with the TP. The animals were euthanized, the prostate and body weights were recorded, and tissues were subjected to hormone assays and histomorphology. In addition, we investigated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in the prostate using immunoblotting. RESULTS: Animals with BPH showed significantly increased absolute and relative prostate weights, increased dihydrotestosterone levels in the serum or prostate and increased PCNA expression in the prostate; however, YJT-treated animals showed significant reductions compared with the animals with TP-induced BPH. Histomorphology also showed that YJT inhibited TP-induced prostatic hyperplasia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that YJT effectively inhibited the development of BPH and might be a useful drug clinically.

25187824|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of water-soluble extracts of Banxiaxiexin decoction, a classical traditional Chinese medicine formulation, on BALB/c mice with experimentally induced ulcerative colitis (UC). Water-soluble extracts of Banxiaxiexin decoction were intragastrically administered to BALB/c mice with oxazolone (OXA)-induced colitis. Sulfasalazine (SASP) was administered intragastrically to OXA-treated mice to establish the SASP group (positive control). Following drug administration, the disease activity index (DAI) and the histopathological inflammation score were recorded. In addition, the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 mRNA in the colonic tissue were determined by fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The DAI and histopathological inflammation score of the model group were significantly greater compared with those of the control group, and the mRNA expression levels of IL-5 and IL-13 in the colonic tissue were also significantly higher in the model group compared with those in the control group. The intragastric administration of water-soluble extracts of Banxiaxiexin decoction significantly lowered the DAI and histopathological inflammation score. The mRNA expression levels of IL-5 and IL-13 in the colonic tissue were also significantly lowered. The therapeutic effect of Banxiaxiexin decoction was found to be comparable to that of SASP. In conclusion, the results from the present study demonstrate that water-soluble extracts of the traditional Chinese medicine formulation Banxiaxiexin decoction have a therapeutic effect on BALB/c mice with OXA-induced colitis.

34590567|t|[Protective effect and mechanism of Angong Niuhuang pill in sepsis-associated brain dysfunction of rats].
34590567|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effect of Angong Niuhuang pill on brain function of rats with sepsis, explore its protective mechanism, and provide the experimental basis for clinical application of Angong Niuhuang pill in the treatment of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into sham operation group, sepsis model group and Angong Niuhuang pill group according to random number table method, with 10 rats in each group. The sepsis model was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP); rats in sham operation group received open and closed abdomen. The rats in the Angong Niuhuang pill group were given Angong Niuhuang pill (0.3 g/kg) by gastric irrigation daily for 3 days before CLP, and the drugs were administrated 12 hours after modeling again. After 24 hours of CLP, the neuroreflex scores were evaluated, white blood cell count (WBC), the levels of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100beta were detected. Then the brain tissue was harvested. After hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the pathological changes of brain tissue were observed under the light microscope. The mRNA expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in brain tissue were detected by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Compared with the sham operation group, the total score of neuroreflex scores in the sepsis model group and the Angong Niuhuang pill group were significantly reduced (4.43+/-1.40, 6.57+/-1.90 vs. 9.40+/-0.84, both P < 0.05), WBC, serum NSE, S100beta were significantly increased [WBC (x10(9)/L): 8.07+/-1.32, 5.84+/-0.94 vs. 3.60+/-0.32; NSE (mug/L): 1.04+/-0.14, 0.61+/-0.07 vs. 0.16+/-0.04; S100beta (ng/L): 255.624+/-30.25, 97.72+/-15.41 vs. 46.88+/-12.03, all P < 0.05], and the mRNA expressions of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in brain tissue were significantly increased [IL-6 mRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 5.668+/-2.195, 3.605+/-1.014 vs. 0.997+/-0.329; TNF-alpha mRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 18.996+/-0.913, 1.746+/-0.710 vs. 0.674+/-0.132, all P < 0.05]. Compared with the sepsis model group, the total score of neuroreflex scores in the Angong Niuhuang pill group was significantly increased (6.57+/-1.90 vs. 4.43+/-1.40, P < 0.05), WBC, serum NSE, S100beta concentration, and the mRNA expressions of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the brain were significantly reduced [WBC (x10(9)/L): 5.84+/-0.94 vs. 8.07+/-1.32, NSE (mug/L): 0.61+/-0.07 vs. 1.04+/-0.14, S100beta (ng/L): 97.72+/-15.41 vs. 255.62+/-30.25, IL-6 mRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 3.605+/-1.014 vs. 5.668+/-2.195, TNF-alpha mRNA (2(-DeltaDeltaCt)): 1.746+/-0.710 vs. 18.996+/-0.913, all P < 0.05]. Brain histopathological observation showed that the hippocampal neurons in the sepsis model group were disordered arrangement, a large number of neuronal nuclei were contracted, and the tissue was loose with obvious edema. Compared with the sepsis model group, the Angong Niuhuang pill group had less nuclear shrinkage and tissue edema. CONCLUSIONS: The pretreatment of the Angong Niuhuang pill can improve the brain dysfunction of septic rats and reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. It is speculated that the Angong Niuhuang pill can protect the brain function in sepsis by inhibiting the inflammatory reaction in the brain.

35586697|t|Mechanism of Peitu Shengjin Formula Shenlingbaizhu Powder in Treating Bronchial Asthma and Allergic Colitis through Different Diseases with Simultaneous Treatment Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking.
35586697|a|Background: Shenlingbaizhu powder (SLBZP), one of the classic Earth-cultivating and gold-generating prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used to treat various diseases. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of SLBZP on bronchial asthma (BA) and allergic colitis (AC) remain to be elucidated. Methods: Network pharmacology and molecular docking technology were used to explore the potential mechanism of SLBZP in treating BA and AC with the simultaneous treatment of different diseases. The potential active compounds of SLBZP and their corresponding targets were obtained from BATMAN-TCM, ETCM, SymMap TCM@TAIWAN, and TCMSP databases. BA and AC disease targets were collected through DisGeNET, TTD, GeneCards, PharmGKB, OMIM, NCBI, The Human Phenotype Ontology, and DrugBank databases. Common targets for drugs and diseases were screened by using the bioinformatics and evolutionary genomics platform. The analyses and visualizations of Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of common targets were carried out by R software. The key targets were screened by using the plug-in "cytoHubba" of Cytoscape software, and the "active compound-key target" network was constructed. Molecular docking analysis was performed using AutoDock software. The miRTarBase database was used to predict microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting key targets, and the key target-miRNA network was constructed. Result: Through screening, 246 active compounds and 281 corresponding targets were obtained. Common targets were mainly enriched in 2933 biological processes and 182 signal pathways to play the role of treating BA and AC. There were 131 active compounds related to key targets. The results of molecular docking showed that the important active compounds in SLBZP had good binding ability with the key targets. The key target-miRNA network showed that 94 miRNAs were predicted. Conclusion: SLBZP has played the role of treating different diseases with the same treatment on BA and AC through the characteristics of multicompound, multitarget, and multipathway of traditional Chinese medicine, which provides a theoretical basis for explaining the mechanism and clinical application of SLBZP treating different diseases with the same treatment in BA and AC.

29956897|t|Sini decoction as an adjuvant therapy for angina pectoris: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
29956897|a|OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the effects and safety of Sini decoction as an adjuvant therapy for patients with angina pectoris. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Excerpt Medica Database, the Cochrane library, Wanfang Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database from the date of its inception until August 1, in 2014. Available literatures were selected according to the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers finished data extraction, checked the data and assessed the methodological quality of studies, independently. The Review Manage Software 5.1.0 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Six trials involving 453 participants were eligible. None of the trials reported the mortality due to angina pectoris. The secondary outcomes showed that Sini decoction, together with nitroglycerin when necessary, may have some effects on reducing the number of angina attacks and the amount of nitroglycerin. But in terms of reducing the duration of angina and improvement of electrocardiogram, there were no statistical differences between Sini decoction group and isosorbide dinitrate group. Only one reported that no adverse events were found. CONCLUSION: Based on this systematic review, Sini decoction can reduce the dosage of nitroglycerin, when compared with isosorbide dinitrate group. And there were no enough evidence in the papers to draw any conclusions for the safety of Sini decoction.

22382321|t|Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang extract protects against chronic brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia via hypoxia-inducible-factor-1alpha-regulated vascular endothelial growth factor signaling in mice.
22382321|a|Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang (HJDT) is a traditional Chinese herbal formula which is widely used clinically. In this study, we investigated the effects of an aqueous (HJDTaq) and an ethanolic (HJDTet) extract of HJDT on chronic brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia in mice. The ischemia was induced by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 30 min. HJDTaq (4 g/kg) and HJDTet (200, 400, 800 mg/kg) were orally administered for 21 d from day 7 before ischemia to day 14 after ischemia. The survival rate decreased to less than 50% at 35 d after ischemia. HJDTet at 400 mg/kg increased the survival rate. HJDTaq (4 g/kg) and HJDTet (400, 800 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the neurological dysfunction, brain atrophy and infarct volume after ischemia. There were few cells positive for CD31, hypoxia-inducible-factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Flk-1 in the sham control. After ischemia, the number increased. HJDTaq (4 g/kg) and HJDTet (400 or 800 mg/kg) further increased the numbers of CD31, HIF-1alpha, VEGF and Flk-1-positive cells in the ischemic hemisphere. We conclude that HJDTaq and HJDTet have neuroprotective effects on chronic brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia and lead to accelerated angiogenesis by HIF-1alpha-regulated VEGF signaling.

8980988|t|Pneumonitis during interferon and/or herbal drug therapy in patients with chronic active hepatitis.
8980988|a|We report four cases of acute pneumonitis due either to interferon, or a herbal drug, "Sho-saiko-to", or both in combination, in patients with chronic active hepatitis, focusing on its pathogenesis and response to prednisolone therapy. These cases shared common clinical features: fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, diffuse infiltrates both on chest radiography and chest computed tomography, restrictive pulmonary functional impairment, and alveolitis on examination of transbronchial lung biopsy, all of which suggest acute interstitial pneumonia. Furthermore, lymphocytosis was observed in association with the dominant CD8+ T-cell subset in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A lymphocyte stimulation test using peripheral blood was positive to interferon in one case and to Sho-saiko-to in another. All patients responded to oral prednisolone therapy. Peripheral soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels decreased in parallel with improvement in the clinical course. All patients were free of symptoms with a follow-up of 1-3 yrs. We conclude that interferon- and/or Sho-saiko-to-induced acute pneumonitis may be due to allergic-immunological mechanisms rather than toxicity, and that peripheral levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor appear to be good markers of disease activity.

23504545|t|Anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects of Yupingfeng powder on chronic bronchitis rats.
23504545|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects of Yupingfeng (, YPF) Powder and its components in rats. METHODS: A rat chronic bronchitis (CB) model was developed using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) combined with bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG). YPF, simple recipe Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge (AM) and Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge plus rhizome of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (AM+RA) decoction were administered (intragastric administration, once a day for 21 days) to rats, to prevent and treat CB. Immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of YPF, AM and AM+RA were tested by serum pharmacology in vitro on splenic lymphocytes of normal rats and alveolar macrophages of CB rats. RESULTS: Inflammation in the pulmonary tissue and the bronchus of CB rats was significantly reduced in the YPF-treatment groups, AM and AM+RA groups demonstrating the efficacy of YPF. Serum samples collected at different times from rats after administration of YPF, AM and AM+RA demonstrated increased proliferation of splenic lymphocytes with area under the effect curve (AUE) of 552.6%, 336.3% and 452.0%, respectively. Treatment of alveolar macrophages with serum samples in YPF, AM or AM+RA group inhibited interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the cell culture media, and the effect was much better in the YPF group compared with AM or AM+RA group, with a higher maximal effect (Emax, P<0.05) and larger AUE (P <0.01 and P<0.05). Moreover, serum from rats treated with AM or AM+RA had similar efficacy, while the efficiency was lower than that treated with YPF. CONCLUSION: YPF demonstrated anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects in a rat model of CB, and timedependent relationships were demonstrated in vitro.

34297271|t|Bie Jia Jian pill enhances the amelioration of bone mesenchymal stem cells on hepatocellular carcinoma progression.
34297271|a|BACKGROUND: The therapeutic efficiency of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in suppressing the recurrence and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been well proved. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of Bie Jia Jian pill (BJJP) combined with bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in HCC progression. METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to identify BMSCs isolated from BALB/c mice. The expressions of biomarkers and apoptosis rate of cancer stem cells (CSCs) enriched from Huh7 cells were also measured. The osteogenic differentiation and adipogenic differentiation ability of isolated BMSCs was determined by oil red O staining and Alizarin Red Staining. CSCs were used to establish the orthotopic HCC model. Histological changes in the liver tissues were examined by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Van Gieson (VG) staining. The cell apoptotic rate in the cancer tissues was detected by TUNEL staining. The cell proliferation antigen Ki67 in the cancer tissues were detected by immunofluorescence assay and PCR, respectively. The levels of CSCs cellular surface markers (CD24, CD133 and EpCAM) and Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway related proteins were detected by PCR and western blot. RESULTS: Treatment of BJJP or BMSCs both improved the morphology induced by HCC and suppressed the differentiation ability of CSCs, as evidenced by down-regulated expressions of CD24, CD133, EpCAM and Ki67. The protective effect of BJJP or BMSCs in cancer tissues can be enhanced by the combination of BJJP and BMSCs. In addition to that, BJJP or BMSCs alone was found to increase the expression of miR-140 and promote cell apoptosis in CSCs, while down-regulation of miR-140 partially reversed the protective effect of BMSCs or BJJP + BMSCs on cancer tissues. BJJP + BMSCs treatment together also can down-regulate the expressions of Wnt3a and beta-catenin. CONCLUSIONS: These results proved the inhibitory role of BJJP + BMSCs in HCC development through regulating miR-140 and Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway.

23542148|t|Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang (Sho-seiryu-to) inhibited cytopathic effect of human respiratory syncytial virus in cell lines of human respiratory tract.
23542148|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang (XQLT, TJ-19, Sho-seiryu-to, so-cheong-ryong-tang) has been used against acute airway diseases for thousands of year in ancient China. Most of the acute airway illnesses are caused by virus. However, without activity against influenza virus, XQLT has been questioned to manage respiratory tract viral infection. Nevertheless, XQLT might be active against airway viruses other than influenza. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is one of the most common respiratory viral pathogens without effective management. However, it is unknown whether XQLT has anti-HRSV activity. AIM OF THE STUDY: We tested the hypothesis that XQLT can effectively minimize HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory tract mucosal cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-HRSV activity of a hot water extract of XQLT was examined by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Its effects on syncytial formation and viral fusion (F) protein were examined directly by microscopy and by western blot, respectively. Ability of XQLT to stimulate IFN-beta was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Hot water extract of XQLT dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cells (P<0.0001), particularly when given before viral inoculation (p<0.0001). XQLT inhibited viral attachment (p<0.0001) and internalization (p<0.0001). 300mug/ml XQLT could decrease both the number and the size of HRSV-induced syncytium without clear effect on the production of viral F protein. XQLT could stimulate epithelial cells to secrete IFN-beta before and after viral inoculation to counteract viral infection (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: XQLT is effective against HRSV infection on airway epithelia by preventing viral attachment, internalization, syncytial formation, and by stimulating interferon secretion.

31872715|t|[Exploration on connotation of Zhigancao Decoction formula syndrome from the perspective of modern pathophysiology and severe cases of critical care and its clinical efficacy on cardioversion,maintenance of sinus rhythm,hemostasis,increasing platelets count,and tonifying deficiency].
31872715|a|Zhigancao decoction recorded in Treatise on Febrile Disease by Zhang Zhongjing in the Han dynasty have been widely used in treating palpitation and irregular pulse by traditional Chinese medicine physicians for thousands of years. It is all known that Zhigancao Decoction is used to treat consumptive disease. However,why it has been used to treat exogenous febrile disease? According to studies,Fumai Decoctions in Treatise on Differentiation and Treatment of Epidemic Febrile Disease,that was modified based on Zhigancao Decoction,have their names without reality. Serious defects,including unclear diagnosis,curative effect,and prognosis,have been found in ancient and modern medical records about Zhigancao Decoction. The indications of Zhigancao Decoction include atrial premature beats,ventricular premature beats,and viral myocarditis; tachyarrhythmia( supraventricular tachycardia,atrial fibrillation)with long interval or conduction block,during or after severe infection or high fever; chronic consumptive disease due to tumor after radiotherapy and chemotherapy,malignant fluid state of tumor,hematopathy,terminal stage of heart failure after major operation,and acute hemorrhage after control of severe infection and other major diseases; cough,phlegm and asthma due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,pulmonary interstitial fibrosis,lung cancer,after lung cancer surgery; increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure due to insufficient capacity after acute blood loss; the symptoms included palpitation,chest tightness,sweating,lassitude,lacking in strength,shortness of breath,syncope,sudden death,cough,expectoration,excessive phlegm,clear and dilute sputum,emaciation,dry and haggard skin,constipation,haemorrhagic,uterine bleeding,enjoy sweet taste,red tongue without moss,knotted pulse,intermittent pulse,thready rapid pulse,and weak pulse. Besides,Zhigancao Decoction has effect on cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm without thrombosis in persistent atrial fibrillation and permanent atrial fibrillation. Zhigancao Decoction could stop bleeding soon for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding,and achieve positivity of occult blood test; Zhigancao Decoction could promote thrombocytopenia for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,with the number of platelets 1x109/L. Zhigancao Decoction could promote the rise of granulocytic,erythroid and megakaryocytic hematopoietic lines in unexplained severe anemia,thrombocytopenia,and leukocyte reduction. Zhigancao Decoction could treat cough,asthma,and chest tightness in lung cancer and after lung cancer surgery; chronic consumptive disease due to lung cancer after lung cancer surgery,hematopathy and acute blood loss,which all belonged to the scope of consumptive disease. Zhigancao Decoction could ascend platelets,which was considered as " oriental interleukins" for the ancients. Zhigancao Decoction possesses dual-directional regulation on anticoagulant and hemostasis,which was considered as " oriental low molecular heparin" and " oriental proton pump inhibitors". Large dose of Rehmannia glutinosa is the key of the efficacy of Zhigancao Decoction. This study is expected to enrich the guidelines for modern medical diagnosis and treatment. However,the clinical evidence,relevant genes and targeting network need to be deepened in future studies. In conclusion,it may be a shortcut to restore and explain Zhigancao Decoction formula syndromes based on modern pathophysiology and severe cases of critical care.

21075188|t|Dangguijakyak-san, a medicinal herbal formula, protects dopaminergic neurons from 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurotoxicity.
21075188|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: Dangguijakyak-san (DJS) is a multi-herbal formula that has long been widely used in traditional Oriental medicine to treat gynecologic disorders, including neurological symptoms. Recent clinical and experimental studies have reported aging and anti-neurodegenerative effects of DJS. In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of DJS on dopaminergic (DA) neurons damaged by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the protective effects of DJS, we analyzed viability in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining in primary DA cells. To explore the possible mechanism(s) of neuroprotection, we assessed anti-oxidant activity by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) levels. To determine mitochondria-mediated apoptotic activity, we examined mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation. RESULTS: DJS at 0.05-5 mug/mL significantly protected SH-SY5Y cells from 6-OHDA toxicity, dose-dependently, and attenuated 6-OHDA damage in primary DA cells. DJS reduced 6-OHDA-induced intracellular ROS production and GSH depletion and inhibited mitochondrial membrane instability, cytosolic cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that DJS has neuroprotective effects in DA neurons against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity through anti-oxidant and anti-mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic activities.

34674717|t|Huanglianjiedu Decoction as an effective treatment for oral squamous cell carcinoma based on network pharmacology and experimental validation.
34674717|a|BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of malignant tumors in oral and maxillofacial region with high fatality. Huanglianjiedu Decoction (HLJDD) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal prescription, which consists of Coptis chinensis Franch, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Phellodendron amurense Rupr and Gardenia jasminoides J.Ellis. Some clinical studies showed HLJDD had good effectiveness on OSCC, but the mechanism is unclear. METHODS: In this study, potential components of HLJDD and putative targets were screened by Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). Combining with potential targets of OSCC searched from Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), we drew protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by Cytoscape v3.2.0 software. After topological analysis we got core targets and further did Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Then we did the in vitro experiments to verify the major biological processes (cell cycle, apoptosis and proliferation) and signaling pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), protein kinase B (AKT)) on OSCC cell lines, SCC-25 and CAL-27. RESULTS: The potential component targets number of Coptis chinensis Franch, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Phellodendron amurense Rupr and Gardenia jasminoides J.Ellis were 39, 93, 81and 88, respectively. Then we got 52 core targets which enriched in cell cycle, apoptosis, proliferation, MAPK activation etc. and obtained TOP30 pathways. On SCC-25 and CAL-27, HLJDD suppressed cell proliferation, induced late apoptosis and inhibited cell invasion and migration which were consistent with the results from network pharmacology analysis. Additionally, in cell cycle, we confirmed HLJDD inhibited G1 phase and arrested in S phase to reduce cell proliferation on SCC-25. In signaling pathways, HLJDD inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular regulatory protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and NF-kappaB p65 (S468) on SCC-25 and CAL-27. CONCLUSIONS: HLJDD played a potential therapeutic role on OSCC via inhibiting p-ERK1/2 and p-NF-kappaB p65 (S468).

31632571|t|An experimental research into the potential therapeutic effects of Anti-Osteoporosis Decoction and Yougui Pill on ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis.
31632571|a|Many traditional Chinese medicine tonifying prescriptions for kidney and spleen have been proved to play various roles in osteoporosis. This study aimed to explore whether Anti-Osteoporosis Decoction (AOD) and Yougui Pill (YGP) have potential therapeutic effects on osteoporosis in ovariectomy-induced rat model. The osteoporosis rat model was established with female Wistar rats by the way of ovariectomy. The chosen rats were randomly divided into five groups (control group, model group, sham group, model + AOD group, and model + YGP group). H&E staining was used to detect the bone histological pathology changes. The bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In addition, western blotting assay was applied to explore the expressions of BMP2, Runx2, Collagen I and Opn. Next, we examined the expression of collagen I by immunohistochemistry staining. Finally, the levels of Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), procollagen type I N propeptide (PINP) and beta-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) were detected. The results revealed that the OVX osteoporosis model was successfully established. AOD and YGP treatment effectively inhibited osteoporosis and reduced the broken trabecular bones. BMD was increased in AOD and YGP treatment. In addition, AOD and YGP treatment groups significantly increased the ALP levels. Furthermore, AOD and YGP significantly increased the expressions of BMP2, Runx2, Collagen I and Opn, while reduced the levels of PINP and beta-CTX in serum compared to OVX model group. In conclusion, AOD and YGP exert regulatory effects on osteoporosis in ovariectomized rats. They may be potential candidates for the therapy and cure of human osteoporosis.

34672230|t|Traditional Herbal Medicine, Sipjeondaebo-Tang, for Cancer-Related Fatigue: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Preliminary Study.
34672230|a|PURPOSE: Sipjeondaebo-tang (SDT) is a widely used traditional herbal medicine for relieving fatigue. This randomized, placebo-controlled, preliminary study evaluated SDT for cancer-related fatigue, which is the most common symptom experienced by patients with cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) score of at least 4 were randomly assigned in a double-blinded manner to receive SDT (3 g 3 times daily) or placebo orally for 3 weeks. The BFI was the primary outcome measure and secondary outcome measures included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), immunoregulatory tests, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 50 participants were randomly assigned and 48 patients completed the trial. Based on intention-to-treat analysis, fatigue, which was the primary outcome, was improved in both arms compared with the baseline, and was significantly better in the SDT group than in the placebo group at week 3 (3.56 +/- 1.18 vs 4.63 +/- 1.83, P = .019). Secondary outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and immunoregulatory tests, did not improve significantly in either group. However, quality of life measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 improved in both arms compared with the baseline, and the global health subscale was significantly better in the SDT group than in the placebo group (P = .02). No significant toxicities were observed. CONCLUSION: SDT may improve cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in patients with cancer. A further randomized clinical trial with large sample size is warranted.

24024331|t|Fangjihuangqi tang improved lower urinary tract dysfunction in benign prostatic hyperplasia rats model.
24024331|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigated the effect and mechanism of Fangjihuangqi Tang (FHT) on lower urinary tract dysfunction induced by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in rats. METHODS: Male rats were randomly divided into seven groups: normal, model, finasteride (0.5 mg/ kg), terazosin (0.5 mg/kg), and FHT (10, 5, 2.5 g/kg). Rats were administered testosterone (0.5 mg sc) for 6 weeks after orchiectomy, excluding the normal group. All rats were intragastrically administered assigned drugs for 4 weeks from the third week. Urodynamics were assessed in rats under anesthesia. Serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) were measured. The prostate index (PI), bladder index (BI), and pathological detection were evaluated. RESULTS: In the model group, the PI, BI, serum DHT, serum PAP, threshold pressure (TP), micturition pressure (MP), and residual urine volume (RV) were significantly higher. Moreover, inter-micturition duration (IMD) was significantly lower and the prostatic and bladder showed obvious pathological changes. The IMD was significantly higher, while BI, TP, MP, and RV were significantly lower and bladder pathological changes were alleviated in the FHT (10, 5 g/kg), finasteride, and terazosin groups. The PI, DHT, and PAP were significantly lower in the finasteride group, but they did not change significantly in the FHT (10, 5, 2.5 g/kg) and terazosin groups. CONCLUSION: FHT could relieve symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction in BPH rats but with no apparent effect on reducing the volume of the enlarged prostate itself.

35469747|t|Successful treatment of immune-related cystitis by Chai-Ling-Tang (Sairei-To) in a gastric carcinoma patient: Case report and literature review.
35469747|a|BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have changed the landscape of advanced cancer treatment. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors can trigger effector T cells against self-antigens as well as tumor antigens, resulting in immune-related toxicities in normal organs, referred to as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). CASE SUMMARY: A 56-year-old man with undifferentiated gastric carcinoma received sintilimab plus paclitaxel and tegafur therapy. After five cycles of treatment, the patient was referred to the hospital for sudden onset urinary frequency, micturition pain, and urinary incontinence. Cystoscopy revealed the entire bladder mucosa was red and edematous but there was no evidence of tumor. Oral administration of Chai-Ling-Tang (Sairei-To) alleviated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Histological analysis revealed numerous infiltrates of CD3-positive and CD8-positive cells into the urothelium but no atypia, indicating a diagnosis of immune-related cystitis. Interestingly, the urothelial epithelium infiltrated by lymphocytes and subepithelial inflammatory cells strongly expressed cell boundary PD-L1. The dose of Chai-Ling-Tang was maintained and stopped 2 months later without recurrence of LUTS. Since recovering from cystitis, the patient remains alive with no disease progression. CONCLUSION: This report shows that Chai-Ling-Tang is safe and effective for treating immune-related cystitis. The detailed mechanism of action requires further investigation.

31004880|t|Modificated Mahuang-Tang, a traditional herbal medicine suppresses inflammatory responses induced by cigarette smoke in human airway epithelial cell and mice.
31004880|a|BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoke (CS) is a major contributor to the high incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) featured as chronic inflammation and airway obstruction. Mahuang-Tang is a traditional polyherbal mixture composed of four different herbs. It is widely used in Asia as a remedy for allergic reaction and inflammation. PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of a modificated Mahuang-Tang water extract (MTWE) against airway inflammation caused by CS and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice and cigarette smoke condensate (CSC)-stimulated NCI-H292 cells. METHODS: CS exposed to animals for 1h per day from day 1 to day 7 and treated with LPS intranasally on day 4. One hour before CS exposure, animals were received MTWE (50 or 100mg/kg) by oral gavage. Inflammatory cell count and cytokines levels were measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Expression levels of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) were analyzed by western blotting. RESULTS: MTWE markedly decreased the neutrophil and other inflammatory cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and reduced proinflammatory mediators as evidenced by the decreases in inflammatory cell recruitment in lung tissue. Furthermore, MTWE meaningfully declined MMP-9 expression and reduced the Erk phosphorylation, caused by the CS and LPS exposure. In in vitro experiments, MTWE suppressed the elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by CSC treatment. MTWE reduced Erk phosphorylation and MMP-9 expression in CSC-stimulated H292 cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, MTWE effectively inhibited the pulmonary inflammation and MMP-9 expression caused by the CS and LPS exposure, which was closely involved in suppression of Erk phosphorylation. These results suggest that MTWE possesses a potential for the treatment of COPD.
31004880|k|CONCLUSION: Overall, MTWE effectively inhibited the pulmonary inflammation and MMP-9 expression caused by the CS and LPS exposure, which was closely involved in suppression of Erk phosphorylation.

33053508|t|From the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Treatment of mental disorders in COVID-19 survivors.
33053508|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to explore the possible benefits of traditional Chinese medicine on the pathogenesis of psychological and mental health of COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to confirm the effects of COVID-19 on psychological and mental health of survivors. In addition to this, on the basis of signs and symptoms, TCM were used on treat mental disorder as per suggested clinical and animal experimental data plus relevant records in classical Chinese medicine books written by Zhang Zhongiing during Han Dynasty. A series of treatment plans were prescribed for COVID-19 survivors with psychological and mental disorders. RESULTS: According to previous extensive studies focusing on effects on mental health of survivors, high incidence was observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) survivors. During investigations of mental health of COVID-19 patients and survivors, it is observed that they also had symptoms of mental disorders and immune dysfunction. Furthermore, it was also proposed that depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were most common mental disorders requiring special attention after the recovery from COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 were analyzed, and the TCM syndrome of the depression, anxiety and PTSD after recovered from COVID19 was interpreted as internal heat and Yin deficiency. These three mental disorders pertains the category of "Lily disease", "hysteria" and "deficient dysphoria" in TCM. CONCLUSION: Lily Bulb, Rhizoma Anemarrhena Decoction and Ganmai Dazao Decoction were used to treat depression. Suanzaoren Decoction, Huanglian Ejiao Decoction and Zhizi Chi Decoction were suggested for anxiety. Moreover, Lily Bulb, Rehmannia Decoction and Guilu Erxian Decoction were the formula for PTSD.

33318603|t|Samul-tang ameliorates oocyte damage due to cyclophosphamide-induced chronic ovarian dysfunction in mice.
33318603|a|Samul-tang (SM), a traditional herbal medicine, has been used to treat menstrual irregularities and infertility in women. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of SM remain elusive. We investigated the potential protective effect of SM against chronic ovarian dysfunction and used bioinformatics analysis to identify its underlying mechanism in a mouse model of cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced diminished ovarian reserve. Female C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with CP three times a week, followed by oral administration of distilled water (CP group) or SM (CP + SM group) for 4 weeks. Four weeks later, the effect of SM was assessed by ovarian tissue histological analysis, steroid hormone measurement, oocyte quality, and mRNA and microRNA microarray analysis in the ovaries. Although SM administration did not prevent CP-induced follicle loss in mice, the quality of oocytes was better in CP + SM mice than in CP mice. Gene expression analysis revealed that the expression of fertilisation- and ovarian follicle development-related genes was altered by CP treatment but normalized after SM administration. Further bioinformatics analysis showed possible interactions between differentially expressed mRNAs and microRNAs. Therefore, we demonstrated the protective effects of SM on ovarian function and oocyte maturation against CP-induced damage via multiple epigenetic mechanisms.

12180716|t|Suppressive effect of hochu-ekki-to on collagen induced arthritis in DBA1J mice.
12180716|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of hochu-ekki-to (HET) decoction on the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. METHODS: CIA was induced in male DBA/IJ mice by immunization with 2 injections of bovine type II collagen (CII). HET was orally administered at different doses and with different schedules. The incidence of arthritis, arthritis index, levels of anti-CII antibody, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and lymphocyte subsets were examined. RESULTS: HET caused suppression of CIA development in a dose dependent fashion and exerted a suppressive effect on CIA when administered from the first CII immunization or from the onset of CIA, but not when administered for 2 weeks before CII immunization. HET inhibited the production of specific anti-CII antibody, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, and tended to normalize the proportions of cells in lymphocyte subsets. CONCLUSION: HET suppresses the development of CIA, and HET redistributes the population of lymphocytes in lymph node and blood and inhibits IL-6 and TNF-alpha secretion in CIA mice.

25199335|a|An 88-year-old woman suffering from femoral neck fracture was transported to the emergency room of a hospital. The patient and her family refused transfusion, despite anemia, stating their affiliation with Jehova's Witnesses. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the following day, anemia (hemoglobin, 7.5 g x dl(-1)) and hypoalbuminemia (albumin, 2.7 g x dl(-1)) were observed, in addition to anorexia and general fatigue. The patient underwent nutritional treatment with a kampo medicine (Juzen-taiho-to), which was administered as a medication due to difficulties with swallowing the powdered form. On the 18th day after admission, anemia (hemoglobin, 8.9 g x dl(-1)) and hypoalbuminemia (3.6 g x dl(-1)) improved, as did anorexia and general fatigue. It is thought that the components Shimotsu-to, a component known to improve anemia, and Shikunshi-to, a vital energy supplementing component, were the main ingredients that conferred the improvements in anemia and hypoalbuminemia. These findings suggest that Chinese herbal medicine for the nutritional treatment of the elderly has minimal side effects.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the protective effects and active ingredients of SMS on myocardial injury (MI) in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SMS and n-butanol extraction of SMS (SMS-Bu) were prepared and administered to ISO-treated mice once a day for 7 consecutive days. The doses were equivalent to the raw medicinal herbs of SMS 5.72, 2.86 and 1.43 g/kg/d, respectively. Propranolol was used as positive control. Serum biomarkers, histopathological and electrocardiographic were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase and myeloperoxidase increased to 4473.6 +/- 322.5, 950.0 +/- 35.0 and 90.4 +/- 12.2 U/L in the model group. SMS and SMS-Bu groups showed a decrease from 10 to 29% for lactate dehydrogenase and from 17 to 42% for creatine kinase, respectively. Both SMS and SMS-Bu significantly attenuated the myeloperoxidase activities (from 42 to 56%) and malondialdehyde levels (from 25 to 45%) compared with the model group. Decreased superoxide dismutase activities in ISO-treated mice were elevated from 19 to 59% when treated with SMS and SMS-Bu. These biochemical results were supported by electrocardiogram (ECG) and histopathological observations. Furthermore, 8 ginsenosides and 16 lignans were identified in SMS-Bu. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that SMS-Bu was the mainly active fraction of SMS which exerted its beneficial effects on MI mainly through protecting myocardial tissue and reducing oxidative damage, and the ginsenosides and lignans may serve as active ingredients of SMS for the treatment of MI.

29853976|t|Japanese Herbal Kampo Hochu-Ekki-To or Juzen-Taiho-To after Surgery for Hip Fracture Does Not Reduce Infectious Complications.
29853976|a|BACKGROUND: Infectious complications after hip fracture surgery are common in the elderly. Although experimental studies have suggested that kampo medicine, Hochu-ekki-to and Juzen-taiho-to, can prevent infectious complications, only a few small clinical studies have been published to date. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of Hochu-ekki-to or Juzen-taiho-to on postoperative infectious complications in patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. METHODS AND DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study using a nationwide inpatient database in Japan, we performed propensity score matching to compare patients who did or did not receive kampo medicine after surgery for hip fracture. SETTINGS: A nationwide inpatient database. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who did or did not receive kampo medicine after surgery for hip fracture. INTERVENTION: Kampo medicine after surgery for hip fracture. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Infectious complications. RESULTS: The proportions of postoperative infectious complications were not significantly different between the 424 propensity-matched pairs with and without kampo medicine (11 versus 8, P = 0.644). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that Hochu-ekki-to or Juzen-taiho-to postoperatively is not associated with decreased occurrence of infectious complications in patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture.

21782419|t|Improving cachectic symptoms and immune strength of tumour-bearing mice in chemotherapy by a combination of Scutellaria baicalensis and Qing-Shu-Yi-Qi-Tang.
21782419|a|BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is characterised by the loss of body mass and directly compromises immune response and the quality of life of cancer patients. In the present study, we set out to investigate the role of Chinese herbs as anticancer medicines and/or chemotherapeutic adjuvants to increase therapeutic efficacy and/or ameliorate given side-effects in animal model. METHODS: Twelve kinds of herbs were chosen from the ingredients of major Chinese herbal medicines, and their effects on the antioxidant activity were investigated. To obtain the anticancer effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) when consumed with minimal side-effects, we investigated the combination effect of Scutellaria baicalensis and Qing-Shu-Yi-Qi-Tang that may enhance the anticancer activity of 5-FU on subcutaneous tumour growth in C57BL/6 mice challenged with Lewis lung carcinoma cells. RESULTS: Qing-Shu-Yi-Qi-Tang, a multiple-component herbal extract, was shown to have high anti-oxidation activity, while S. baicalensis (Chinese skullcap) was demonstrated to have high tumour-growth inhibition activity. Thus, S. baicalensis and Qing-Shu-Yi-Qi-Tang were evaluated for their combinaton effects on the cancer-induced cachectic murine upon receiving 5-FU chemotherapy. As a result, tumour masses and losses of carcass and/or gastrocnemius muscle were found to be significantly decreased. This combination otherwise increased both Th1/Th2 ratio and NK cytotoxicity. In the mice receiving with or without 5-FU, the serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) increased by all means but otherwise decreased when the herbal combination was administrated. Additionally, the expressions of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and muscle RING finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) decreased in the gastrocnemius muscle when the herbal combination was applied. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that the combination of S. baicalensis and Qing-Shu-Yi-Qi-Tang is able to ameliorate cachectic symptoms and positively stimulate anti-tumour immunity while undergoing chemotherapy in animal model.

30910581|t|Angong Niuhuang Pill as adjuvant therapy for treating acute cerebral infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
30910581|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Angong Niuhuang Pill (ANP) is a well-known traditional Chinese patent medicine. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ANP as an adjuvant therapy in patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI) and acute intracerebral hemorrhage (AIH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a literature search in Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP database from their inceptions to April 2018. Randomized controlled trials evaluating ANP as an adjuvant therapy for acute stroke were selected. Risk ratio (RR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated between with and without ANP therapy. RESULTS: Eighteen trials involving 1,601 patients were identified and analyzed. Meta-analysis showed that ANP plus usual treatment significantly improved the total response rate in patients with ACI (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.14-1.41) and AIH (RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.14-1.38) compared with the usual treatment alone. Adjuvant treatment with ANP also significantly reduced the neurologic deficit score in patients with ACI (WMD -3.64; 95% CI -4.97 to - 2.31) and AIH (WMD -3.52; 95% CI -5.51 to -1.54). Moreover, ANP significantly improved the Glasgow Coma Scale in patients with ACI (WMD 1.18; 95% CI 0.79-1.56) and AIH (WMD 2.28; 95% CI 1.37-3.19). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant treatment with ANP appears to improve the total response rate and neurologic deficit score in patients with ACI and AIH. More well-designed trials are required due to the suboptimal methodological quality of the included trials.
30910581|k|CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant treatment with ANP appears to improve the total response rate and neurologic deficit score in patients with ACI and AIH.

31331548|t|Use of Chinese herbal medicines by rheumatoid arthritis patients was associated with lower risk of stroke: A retrospective cohort study.
31331548|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have increased risk of developing stroke. The use Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) is increasing, but whether they can reduce the risk of developing stroke remains unclear. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study to compare the effect of CHMs use on the subsequent stroke risk in RA individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using claims data from the National Health Insurance of Taiwan, we identified 7925 newly-diagnosed RA patients with no history of previous stroke who were 20 years of age or older between 1998 and 2010. From this sample, we enrolled 3134 CHMs users and 3134 non-CHMs users, randomly selected using propensity scores matching from the remaining cases. They were followed until the end of 2012 to record stroke incidence. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compute the hazard ratio of stroke with regard to CHMs use. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 299 CHMs users and 395 non-CHMs users developed stroke, representing incidence rates of 10.94 and 16.69, respectively, per 1000 person-years. CHMs use was associated with 38% (adjusted HR: 0.62; 95% confidence interval: 0.54-0.73) lower subsequent risk of stroke. The most prominent effect was observed in those receiving CHMs for over two years. The following seven commonly-prescribed CHMs were found to lessen the stroke risk: Dan-Shen, Tian-Hua-Feng, Fu-Zi, Shao-Yao-Gan-Cao-Tang, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San, Ge-Gen-Tang, and Gui-Zhi-Shao-Yao-Zhi-Mu-Tang. CONCLUSION: The CHMs use was associated with lower risk of stroke for RA patients, suggesting that it could be integrated into conventional therapy to prevent subsequent stroke incident.

23236767|a|OBJECTIVE: To understand the possibility of estimating the anti-inflammation effect of Liuwei Dihuang Wan (LWW) in rat by having developed HPLC-UV metabonomic technology. METHOD: The hydrophilic or lipophilic constituent group of LWW was extracted by distilled water or acetic ether respectively. The anti-inflammation effects of different LWW dosages and extractions were measured by traditional method respectively. Then, metabonomic analysis was performed. RESULT: The high dosage of LWW extraction (16.5 g x kg(-1))could inhibit the swell of rat palm significantly, but there are not statistically significant effect of low dosage group. Nevertheless, the metabonomic study showed that LWW extraction could restore obviously the rat HPLC-UV urinary profiling disturbed by inflammation in low dosage, especially the hydrophilic constituent group. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that the developed metabonomic technology based on HPLC-UV might be used as a potentially powerful tool for estimating the anti-inflammation effect of LWW with sensitivity and integrity.

26597287|t|Sini powder () decoction alleviates mood disorder of insomnia by regulating cation-chloride cotransporters in hippocampus.
26597287|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of Sini Powder () decoction (SND) in the treatment of insomnia. METHODS: The rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, model, SND-treated, and Estazolamtreated groups (n=15 in each group). Sleep deprivation (SD) rat model was established using the modifified multiple platform method for 14 h per day for 14 days, and the behavior of the rats were observed. Na-K-Cl-cotransporter (NKCC1) and K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter (KCC2) in the hippocampus were tested by immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blot. RESULTS: SD rats displayed anxiety-like behavior, which was alleviated by SND. The protein expressions of NKCC1 and KCC2 in the hippocampus were signifificantly decreased in SD rats compared with those in control rats (P<0.05); these proteins were signifificantly increased by SND (P<0.05). The mRNA expression of KCC2 was signifificantly decreased in SD rats (0.62+/-0.35 vs. 2.29+/-0.56; P=0.044), while SND showed a tendency to increase the mRNA of KCC2 in SD rats (P>0.05). By contrast, the mRNA expression of NKCC1 was signifificantly increased in the hippocampus of SD rats (6.58+/-1.54 vs. 2.82+/-0.32; P=0.011), while SND decreased the mRNA expression of NKCC1 (6.58+/-1.54 vs. 2.79+/-0.81; P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Chinese medicine SND could alleviate mood disorder of SD rats by regulating cation-chloride cotransporters, such as NKCC1 and KCC2. These fifindings would have major implications in the mechanism of SND to relieve insomnia.

24250714|t|High-frequency ultrasound imaging to evaluate liver fibrosis progression in rats and yi guan jian herbal therapeutic effects.
24250714|a|The animals used in liver fibrosis studies must usually be sacrificed. Ultrasound has been demonstrated to have the ability to diagnose hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in experimental small-animal models. However, few studies have used high-frequency ultrasound (HFU, 40 MHz) to monitor changes in the rat liver and other hollow organs longitudinally. In this study, liver fibrosis was induced by administering dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in SD rats, aged 8 weeks, for three consecutive days per week for up to 4 weeks. A Chinese herbal medicine Yi Guan Jian (YGJ) was orally administered (1.8 g/kg daily) to DMN-induced liver fibrosis rats for 2 weeks. Compared with the normal control rats, rats treated with DMN for either 2 weeks or 4 weeks had significantly lower body weights, liver indexes and elevation of hydroxyproline, GOT, and GPT contents. YGJ herbal treatment remarkably prevented rats from DMN-induced liver fibrosis. The HFU scoring results among the normal controls, 2-week DMN-treated rats, 4-week DMN-treated rats, and combined 2-week YGJ therapy with 4-week DMN-treated rats also reached statistical significance. Thus, HFU is an accurate tool for the longitudinal analysis of liver fibrosis progression in small-animal models, and the YGJ may be useful in reversing the development of hepatic fibrosis.

31401321|t|UPLC-ESI-IT-TOF-MS metabolomic study of the therapeutic effect of Xuefu Zhuyu decoction on rats with traumatic brain injury.
31401321|a|It has been widely reported that Xuefu Zhuyu decoction (XFZYD), a traditional Chinese medicine, is effective in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the mechanism of the therapeutic process is still not fully understood. Metabolomic technique can be used to explore the mechanisms underlying the treatment of TBI with XFZYD. The purpose of this work was to investigate the metabolic characteristics of blood samples from rats with and without XFZYD treatment and the dynamic changes in metabolite profiles on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 after injury (within the severe phase of TBI) based on untargeted UPLC-ESI-IT-TOF-MS analysis. Pattern recognition, clustering analysis and metabolic pathway analysis were used to analyse the metabolomic data of three groups (a sham-operated group, a TBI model, and an XFZYD-treated TBI model). The results showed that XFZYD reversed the abnormalities in the levels of small-molecule metabolites (such as L-acetylcarnitine, L-tryptophan, indoleacrylic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, hypotaurine, LysoPC(18:1)(11Z), creatine, L-phenylalanine and L-leucine) in TBI rats through six metabolic pathways (including phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; phenylalanine metabolism; valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; tryptophan metabolism; and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism) involved in the therapy process. XFZYD regulated the metabolic disorders of endogenous markers by the possible mechanisms of neuroprotection, energy metabolism, inflammatory response and oxidative stress. This study revealed the holistic and dynamic metabolic changes caused by XFZYD in rats with TBI and provided important research methods and approaches for exploring the multiple metabolites and metabolic pathways involved in the therapeutic effect of XFZYD on TBI.

34713840|t|Clinical efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine Xiao Yao San in insomnia combined with anxiety.
34713840|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with long-term insomnia generally experience anxiety and depression. Traditional sleeping pills and anti-anxiety drugs have certain limitations. Xiao Yao San (XYS), a complementary and alternative therapy, has been widely used to treat insomnia combined with anxiety. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XYS in the treatment of insomnia combined with anxiety. METHODS: Related literature was retrieved from 8 electronic databases from the establishment time to March 2021. The subjects were diagnosed with insomnia combined with anxiety. We assessed the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) according to the Cochrane Handbook. Data analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: The analysis includes 9 RCTs involving 681 patients. Meta-analysis supported that as an auxiliary drug for Western medicine (WM), XYS could enhance the clinical efficacy of insomnia calculated according to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome score scale (risk ratio [RR]: 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-1.43; P = .0002) and reduced the scores of Hamilton Anxiety Scale (mean difference [MD]: -5.19; 95% CI: -7.78 to -2.60; P < .001), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (MD: -3.35; 95% CI: -4.86 to -1.84; P < .001), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (MD: -9.38; 95% CI: -10.20 to -8.75; P < .001), TCM syndrome score scale for insomnia (MD: -4.45; 95% CI: -6.65 to -2.24; P < .001), and TCM syndrome score scale for anxiety (MD: -5.54; 95% CI: -9.48 to -1.6; P = .006). The summary analysis also shows that the separate use of XYS was advantageous in reducing the scores of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (MD: -3.70; 95% CI: -6.31 to -1.09; P = .005), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (MD: -1.82; 95% CI: -2.39 to -1.24; P < .001), and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (MD: -10.79; 95% CI: -14.09 to -7.49; P < .001). The incidence of adverse events with XYS as an ancillary drug or used separately was lower than that in the WM. CONCLUSION: Our systematic evaluation and meta-analysis showed that XYS combined with WM or XYS alone was beneficial for improving sleep quality and relieving anxiety. Due to the low methodological quality, small sample size, and significant heterogeneity of RCTs, more rigorous and scientific clinical trials are required to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of XYS. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020190613.

32256653|t|Network Pharmacology-Based Strategy for Predicting Therapy Targets of Traditional Chinese Medicine Xihuang Pill on Liver Cancer.
32256653|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential therapy targets and pharmacological mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Xihuang pill in liver cancer based on network pharmacology. METHODS: Drug ingredients-target network was constructed based on the target sets of Xihuang pill and liver cancer. The overlapping genes between Xihuang pill targets and liver cancer-related molecular targets were investigated using comparative analysis. Moreover, the PPI network and module was constructed based on overlapping genes and hub nodes, respectively, followed by the pathway enrichment analysis. RESULTS: A drug ingredients-target network was established with 1184 nodes and 11035 interactions. Moreover, a total of 106 overlapping genes were revealed between drug targets and liver cancer molecular targets. Furthermore, a PPI network and 4 modules were further investigated based on overlapping genes, respectively. These hub nodes such as VEGFA and EGFR were mainly enriched in GO functions including positive regulation of MAP kinase activity, activation of protein kinase activity, regulation of MAP kinase activity, and pathways like proteoglycans in cancer, bladder cancer, and estrogen signaling. CONCLUSION: VEGFA and EGFR might be potential therapy targets of Xihuang pill in liver cancer. Furthermore, the effect of Xihuang pill on liver cancer might be realized by targeting VEGFA and EGFR in pathways like proteoglycans in cancer and estrogen signaling.

25924470|a|To investigate the effect of huangqin tang on expression of cytokines and NF-kappaB p65 in rats with ulcerative colitis (UC), and to probe into its underlying mechanisms of action. The mode of UC rats with cell immunoreactivity was made using compound method (trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and ethanol). Rats were randomly divided into control group, model group, SASP group and high dose, middle dose and low dose of huangqin tang group. The food intake, body weight and microscopic damage of rats in each group were evaluated after being treated for five days. The blood and colon tissue were also collected. Production of NO was detected by Griess assay, the expression levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, PGE2 were detected by ELISA. ICH method was undertaken to determine the expression of NF-kappaB p65 protein in colon tissue. The food intake and body weight of model group rats were lower than that of control group. The expression levels of NO, IL-6, TNF-alpha, PGE2 in serum and NF-kappaB p65 protein of colon tissue in model group were higher than that of control group. The above indexes were ameliorated in high and middle dose of huangqin tang groups. But there was no significant difference with SASP group. NF-kappaB p65 may be involved in the pathogenesis of UC, and huangqin tang can inhibit the relative activity of NF-kappaB p65, and decrease the expression levels of NO, IL-6, TNF-alpha and PGE2.

24972580|t|Effect of Guizhi Decoction ([symbols; see text]) on heart rate variability and regulation of cardiac autonomic nervous imbalance in diabetes mellitus rats.
24972580|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe abnormalities in heart rate variability (HRV) in diabetic rats and to explore the effects of treatment with Guizhi Decoction ([symbols; see text]) on cardiac autonomic nervous (CAN) imbalance. METHODS: A radio-telemetry system for monitoring physiological parameters was implanted into rats to record electrocardiac signals and all indictors of HRV [time domain measures: standard deviation of all RR intervals in 24 h (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), percentage of differences between adjacent RR intervals greater than 50 ms (PNN50), and standard deviation of the averages of RR intervals (SDANN); frequency domain measures: low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), total power (TP), and LF/HF ratio]. The normal group was randomly selected, and the remaining rats were used to establish streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic model. After 4 weeks, the model rats were divided into the model group, the methycobal group, and the Guizhi Decoction group, 9 rats in each group. Four weeks after intragastric administration of the corresponding drugs, the right atria of the rats were collected for immunohistochemical staining of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) to observe the distribution of the sympathetic and vagus nerves in the right atrium. The myocardial homogenate from the interventricular septum and the left ventricle was used for determination of TH, CHAT, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), nerve growth factor (NGF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: (1) STZ rats had elevated blood glucose levels, reduced body weight, and decreased heart rate; there was no difference between the model group and the drug treated groups. (2) Compared with the model group, only RMSSD and TP increased in the methycobal group significantly (P<0.05); SDNN, RMSSD, PNN50, LF, HF, and TP increased, LF/HF decreased (P<0.05), and SDANN just showed a decreasing trend in the Guizhi Decoction group (P>0.05). TH increased, CHAT decreased, and TH/CHAT increased in the myocardial homogenate of the model group (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, left ventricular TH reduced in the methycobal group; and in the Guizhi Decoction group CHAT increased, while TH and TH/CHAT decreased (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, CNTF in the interventricular septum increased in the methycobal group (P<0.05); GAP-43 increased, NGF decreased, and CNTF increased (P<0.05) in the Guizhi Decoction group. There were significant differences in the reduction of NGF and elevation of CNTF between the Guizhi Decoction group and the methycobal group (P<0.05). (3) Immunohistochemical results showed that TH expression significantly increased and CHAT expression significantly decreased in the myocardia of the model group, whereas TH expression decreased and CHAT expression increased in the Guizhi Decoction group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Guizhi Decoction was effective in improving the function of the vagus nerve, and it could alleviate autonomic nerve damage.

35401241|t|Tianma Gouteng Decoction Exerts Pregnancy-Protective Effects Against Preeclampsia via Regulation of Oxidative Stress and NO Signaling.
35401241|a|Preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy-specific syndrome with the major molecular determinants of placenta-borne oxidative stress and consequently impaired nitric oxide (NO) generation, has been considered to be one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity as well as mortality and preterm delivery worldwide. Several medical conditions have been found to be associated with increased PE risk, however, the treatment of PE remains unclear. Here, we report that Tianma Gouteng Decoction (TGD), which is used clinically for hypertension treatment, regulates oxidative stress and NO production in human extravillous trophoblast-derived TEV-1 cells. In human preeclamptic placental explants, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were elevated and NO production was inhibited, while TGD treatment at different periods effectively down-regulated the H2O2-induced ROS levels and significantly up-regulated the H2O2-suppressed NO production in human TEV-1 cells. Mechanistically, TGD enhanced the activity of total nitric oxide synthase (TNOS), which catalyze L-arginine oxidation into NO, and simultaneously, TGD promoted the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), two isoforms of nitric oxide synthetases (NOS) in human placenta, resulting in the increased NO generation. More importantly, TGD administration not only increased the weight gain during pregnancy and revealed a hypotensive effect, but also improved the placental weight gain and attenuated fetal growth restriction in an NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced mouse PE-like model. Our results thereby provide new insights into the role of TGD as a potentially novel treatment for PE.

34956382|t|Metabolomic Study of Zuojin Pill in Relieving 1-Methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine-Induced Chronic Atrophic Gastritis.
34956382|a|The classic prescription Zuojin Pill (ZJP) shows a good therapeutic effect on chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG); it is of great significance to clarify its specific mechanism. Therefore, we explore the mechanism of ZJP on MNNG-induced CAG by integrating approaches. First of all, through the pathological changes of gastric tissue and the expression level of PGI and PGI/II in serum, the expression of inflammation-related factors was determined by RT-PCR to determine the efficacy. Then, UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used for plasma and urine metabolomic analysis to screen the specific potential biomarkers and metabolic pathway of ZJP in ameliorating CAG and to explore its possible mechanism. ZJP significantly ameliorate the pathological injury of gastric tissue, increase levels of PGI and PGI/II, and reduce the expression level of proinflammatory factors. Through metabolomic analysis, 9 potential metabolic differences were identified and 6 related metabolic pathways were enriched. These findings indicate for the first time the potential mechanism of ZJP in improving CAG induced by MNNG and are of great significance to the clinical development and application of ZJP-related drugs.

29906536|t|Mahuang decoction mitigates airway inflammation and regulates IL-21/STAT3 signaling pathway in rat asthma model.
29906536|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Nowadays, bronchial asthma is still a severe disease threatening human health, and it is incumbent upon us to seek effective therapeutic drugs. Mahuang decoction (MHD), a classic famous Chinese prescription, has been used for thousands of years to prevent phlegm from forming, stop coughing and relieve asthma, but the relevant mechanism has not been thoroughly clarified. This study aims to investigate the anti-airway inflammation effect of MHD and the possible molecular mechanism underlying IL21/STAT3 signaling pathway, so as to provide guidance for the treatment of MHD on bronchial asthma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specific pathogen free SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: normal control group, model group, positive group (Compound methoxyphenamine), MHD-treated groups at doses of 10ml/kg, 5ml/kg and 2.5ml/kg, 10 rats in each group. Except for the normal control group, rats in other groups were sensitized with ovalbumin via introperitoneal injection and challenged with ovalbumin inhalation to trigger asthma model. At 24h after the last excitation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of every rat was drawn and the number of inflammatory cells was analyzed using cell counting method. ELISA method was performed to determine the concentrations of TXB2, 6-keto-PGF1alpha, MMP-9, TIMP-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 and TNF-alpha in rat serum. The protein expressions of IL-21, IL-21R, STAT3 and p-STAT3 in murine pulmonary tissues were assessed with western blotting analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the airway wall and airway smooth muscle of murine pulmonary tissues significantly thickened and massive inflammatory cells infiltration occurred around the bronchus in the model group, and the cell counts of WBC and EOS in BALF were also apparently increased, which indicated the rat asthma model was successfully established. MHD or Compound methoxyphenamine not only alleviated the pulmonary inflammatory pathological damages, but also down- regulated the numbers of WBC and EOS in BALF. What's more, the levels of TXB2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, ILs-(2, 4, 5) and TNF-alpha in rat serum were lessened by the treatment of MHD. In western blotting analysis, treatment with 10ml/kg or 5ml/kg MHD markedly declined the increased protein expressions of IL-21, IL-21R, STAT3 and p-STAT3 in lung tissues of asthmatic rats to normal level. CONCLUSION: MHD intervention demonstrated a strong inhibitory action on the secretion of inflammatory mediators as well as the inflammatory cell infiltration in pulmonary tissues of asthmatic rats, and also depressed the protein expressions of IL-21, IL-21R, STAT3 and p-STAT3 in pulmonary tissues. MHD effectively mitigates airway inflammation and regulates the IL-21/STAT3 signaling pathway in rat asthma model.

24723962|t|Synergistic Effect of Zuo Jin Wan on DDP-Induced Apoptosis in Human Gastric Cancer SGC-7901/DDP Cells.
24723962|a|A traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, Zuo Jin Wan (ZJW), has been found as an anticancer drug in human cancer. In this study, we investigated the synergistic effect of ZJW extracts on DDP-induced apoptosis in human gastric cancer SGC-7901/DDP cells. Our results demonstrated that ZJW extracts could increase the sensitivity of SGC-7901/DDP cells to DDP by increasing the concentration of DDP in cytoplasm and enhance the proapoptosis of DDP by upregulating the JNK and Bax expression, downregulating the Bcl-2 expression, increasing the accumulation of Cytochrome C in cytoplasm, and promoting the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9. In vivo, ZJW extracts enhanced the inhibiting effect of DDP on tumor growth in SGC-7901/DDP xenograft model and upregulated the expression of p-JNK and Bax but downregulated the Bcl-2 expression in xenograft tumors. In conclusion, in vitro and in vivo, ZJW extracts could enhance the proapoptotic effect of DDP by promoting the activation of JNK and the expression of Bcl-2, inhibiting the Bax expression, followed by increasing the release of Cytochrome C from mitochondria to cytoplasm, and finally activating the caspase cade reaction. Our results implied that ZJW might serve as a synergistic drug with chemotherapeutic drugs DDP in the treatment of gastric cancer.

30140298|t|Protective Effects of Rhubarb in Rats with Acute Pancreatitis and the Role of Its Active Compound Rhein on Mitochondria of Exocrine Cells.
30140298|a|Da-Cheng-Qi-Decoction (DCQD) has been used in the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP) in China for many years. The aim of the current study was to examine the principal ingredient rhubarb of DCQD and its potential link to the pancreatic repair effects in rats with AP. The pancreatitis was induced in SD rats by intraperitoneal injections of cerulein. The results showed that rhubarb significantly increased blood perfusion of pancreatic tissue, reversed mitochondrial damage, and promoted pancreatic acinar and stellate cell proliferation. In addition, the rhein (from rhubarb) had high distribution in pancreas tissue and protected mitochondria in AR42J cells via the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and activity inhibition of AMPK (P < 0.05). The results provide some preclinical evidence on the protective effects of DCQD for the treatment of acute pancreatitis. Rhein is regarded to be the active compound of rhubarb and can be expected to be a new compound for the treatment of AP.

34925005|t|The Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Pruritus Mechanisms of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction in the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis.
34925005|a|Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic skin disease driven by a T-cell-mediated immune response, with inflammation and pruritus being its main clinical manifestations. Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDT), which is an ancient Chinese medicine herbal formula derived from Wai-Tai-Mi-Yao, is a potentially effective treatment for AD. We aimed to clarify the anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritus mechanisms of HLJDT in AD treatment. We performed immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Luminex-based direct multiplex immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and flow cytometry to address the abovementioned aims. HLJDT significantly reduced clinical symptoms and ear swelling in AD-like mice by inhibiting the production of cytokines [histamine, interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-31, and IL-33], substance P (SP), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV-1), and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Additionally, HLJDT significantly suppressed the protein expression levels and positive cell percentage of CD28, CD80, CD86, CD207, CD326, MHCII, and OX40 in the lymphoid nodes. Moreover, HLJDT significantly suppressed mRNA and protein expression of tyrosine-protein kinase (JAK1), histamine H4 receptor, and IL-4Ralpha, as well as the protein expression of GRP, SP, and TRPV-1 in the root ganglion. Our findings indicate that HLJDT can treat AD by regulating the antigen presentation function of dendritic cells, weakening T-lymphocyte activation, and subsequently exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritus effects.

31359679|t|[Molecular mechanism of Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba drug pair against sepsis based on integrative pharmacology platform of traditional Chinese medicine].
31359679|a|Guizhi Decoction is a resolving agent,which is a classic prescription for traditional Chinese medicine. It is effective in the treatment of sepsis in clinical practice. However,due to the complexity of the prescription,its anti-sepsis mechanism is difficult to be clarified. The " Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba" drug pair,as the classic compatibility for medicinal and medicinal herbs,is the core of Guizhi Decoction. In this study,Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba drug pair was used as the research object and the molecular mechanism of its treatment of sepsis was investigated by analyzing the chemical compositions with integrative pharmacology platform( TCMIP,http://www.tcmip.cn/),predicting disease target,analyzing gene function and pathway of " Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba" in treatment of sepsis,and establishing a multi-dimensional network relationship of " Chinese medicine-chemical components-core targets-key pathways". The prediction results of " Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba" drug pair showed that its anti-sepsis effect was associated with 45 active components,and the active components played an anti-sepsis role through multiple targets and pathways,involving inflammatory targets such as PF4,MyD88,TLR4,BDKRB2,CD14,and NOS3. The sepsis was relieved mainly by regulating Toll like signaling pathway,Fox O signaling pathway,chemokines signaling pathway,thyroid and insulin endocrine signaling pathways and biological processes. This study provides a scientific basis for further development of Cinnamomi Ramulus-Paeoniae Radix Alba drug pair and Guizhi Decoction against sepsis.

32256358|t|An Integrated Pharmacology-Based Analysis for Antidepressant Mechanism of Chinese Herbal Formula Xiao-Yao-San.
32256358|a|Clinical studies and basic science experiments have widely demonstrated the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of the herbal formula Xiao-Yao-San (XYS). However, the system mechanism of these effects has not been fully characterized. The present study conducted a comprehensive network pharmacological analysis of XYS and sorted all pharmacologically active components (149) through the TCMSP webserver. Then, all potential molecular targets (449) were predicted, of which there were 99 genes clearly related to depression. To further investigate the mechanism of antidepressant effects of XYS, a compound-depression targets (C-DTs) network was constructed, and Gene Ontology (GO) functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the 99 targets. Enrichment results revealed that XYS could regulate multiple aspects of depression through these targets, related to metabolism, neuroendocrine function, and neuroimmunity. Prediction and analysis of protein-protein interactions resulted in selection of three hub genes (AKT1, TP53, and VEGFA). In addition, a total of seven ingredients from XYS could act on these hub genes and they were identified through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS), including paeoniflorin, quercetin, luteolin, acacetin, aloe-emodin, Glyasperin C, kaempferol. Hereafter, we investigated the effects of paeoniflorin and its predicted target, the results suggest that it can reverse the neurotoxicity produced by CORT and could be a neuroprotective effect by promoting the phosphorylation of Akt. Overall, our research revealed the complicated antidepressant mechanism of XYS, and also provided a rational strategy for revealing the complex composition and function of Chinese herbal formula.

33551951|t|Use of Chinese Herbal Medicines Is Related to a Reduction in Depression Risk Among Patients With Insomnia: A Matched Cohort Study.
33551951|a|Objective: Subjects with insomnia have a higher risk of depression, thus possibly making them live with serious health conditions. To date, information regarding the effect of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs), a commonly used complementary and alternative medicine, on depression risk among people with insomnia is still unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of CHMs on the risk of depression among individuals with insomnia. Methods: This cohort study used a national health insurance database to identify 68,573 subjects newly diagnosed with insomnia, aged 20-70 years, who received treatment between 1998 and 2010. Using propensity score matching, we randomly selected 26,743 CHMs users and 26,743 non-CHMs users from this sample. All enrollees were followed to the end of 2012 to identify any treatment for depression as the end point. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute the adjusted hazard ratio of depression associated with CHMs use. Results: After utilizing the propensity score matching, we randomly selected 26,743 CHMs users and 26,743 non-CHMs users from this sample. During follow up, 3,328 CHMs users and 6,988 non-CHMs users developed depression at incidence rates of 17.24 and 37.97 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. CHMs users had a lower depression risk than the non-CHMs users (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.44; 95% Confidence Interval, 0.42-0.46). The greatest effect was observed for those taking CHMs for more than 2 years. Gegen, Huangqin, Dan-Shen, Beimu, Dahuang, Shegan, Shu-jing-huo-xue-tang, Ge-gen-tang, Shao-yao-gan-cao-tang and Ping wei san were significantly associated with a lower risk of depression. Conclusions: Findings from this study demonstrated that adding CHMs to conventional treatment significantly reduces depression risk among patients with insomnia.

25977697|t|Sagunja-Tang Improves Lipid Related Disease in a Postmenopausal Rat Model and HepG2 Cells.
25977697|a|The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of Sagunja-tang on the lipid related disease in a rat model of menopausal hyperlipidemia and lipid accumulation in methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-induced HepG2 cells. In in vivo study using menopausal hyperlipidemia rats, Sagunja-tang reduced retroperitoneal and perirenal fat, serum lipids, atherogenic index, cardiac risk factor, media thickness, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis score, when compared to menopausal hyperlipidemia control rats. In HepG2 cells, Sagunja-tang significantly decreased the lipid accumulation, total cholesterol levels, and low-density/very-low-density lipoprotein levels. Moreover, Sagunja-tang reversed the methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-induced decrease in the protein levels of critical molecule involved in cholesterol synthesis, sterol regulatory element binding protein-2, and low-density lipoprotein receptor and inhibited protein levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase as well as activity. Phosphorylation level of AMP-activated protein kinase was stimulated by Sagunja-tang. These results suggest that Sagunja-tang has effect on inhibiting hepatic lipid accumulation through regulation of cholesterol synthesis and AMPK activity in vitro. These observations support the idea that Sagunja-tang is bioavailable both in vivo and in vitro and could be developed as a preventive and therapeutic agent of hyperlipidemia in postmenopausal females.

34471004|t|Clarifying the pharmacological mechanisms of action of Shenfu Decoction on cardiovascular diseases using a network pharmacology approach.
34471004|a|Since the molecular mechanisms underlying in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are extremely complex and have not yet been elucidated in detail, CVD remain the leading cause of death worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine involves the treatment of disease from an overall perspective, and its therapeutic effects on CVD have been demonstrated. However, the mechanisms contributing to the multiscale treatment of cardiovascular diseases at the systematic level remain unclear. Network pharmacology methods and a gene chip data analysis were integrated and applied in the present study, which was conducted to investigate the potential target genes and related pathways of Shenfu Decoction (SFD) for the treatment of myocardial injury. The gene chip analysis was initially performed, followed by network pharmacology to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) and a functional enrichment analysis. Protein-protein networks were constructed and a module analysis was conducted. A network analysis was used to identify the target genes of SFD. Regarding the results obtained, 1134 DEG were identified using the STRING website. The module analysis revealed that nine hub genes exhibited ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Therefore, SFD significantly alters the expression of ubiquitination-related genes and, thus, plays an important therapeutic role in the treatment of heart failure. In conclusion, hub genes may provide a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of as well as candidate targets for SFD therapy.

16161452|t|[Protective effects of Sini decoction on adriamycin-induced heart failure and its mechanism: role of superoxide dismutase].
16161452|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in Adriamycin (ADR)-induced heart failure and the protective effects of Sini decoction (SND). METHOD: SD rats were randomly divided into three groups, control group, heart failure group and SND group. ADR was injected in the rats of heart failure group and SND group by caudal vein. After injection, the rats in SND group were given SND (3.75 g x kg(-1) x d(-1), p.o.). Three weeks later, cardiac function, content of malondialdehyde (MDA) of both myocardium and mitochondria and activity of Cu-Zn SOD and Mn SOD were measured. The mRNA expression of Cu-Zn SOD and Mn SOD were also detected by RT-PCR. RESULT: Compared with control group, LVSP and +/- dp/dt max were obviously decreased, while LVEDP was markedly increased in the heart failure group. The mRNA expression and the activity of Cu-Zn SOD and Mn SOD in heart failure group were obviously lower than that in the controls'. In addition, the MDA content of both myocardium and mitochondria were clearly increased in heart failure rats. In SND-treated rats, the cardiac function, the activity and the mRNA expression of Cu-Zn SOD and Mn SOD were significantly elevated and the content of MDA was reduced, which had no statistic difference with the rats in control group. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that oxidative stress is present in the mitochondria of myocardium in ADR-induced heart failure rats and it can be eased by SND. The mechanism may be closely related to SOD.

23219731|t|The anti-osteoporotic effect of Yijung-tang in an ovariectomized rat model mediated by inhibition of osteoclast differentiation.
23219731|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Yijung-tang (YJ), a traditional Asian medicine, is used to treat various diseases. However, its anti-osteoporotic effect and mechanism of action remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-osteoporotic effect of YJ in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups as follows: sham-operated, ovariectomized (OVX), OVX rats treated with 100 g/kg/day 17-estradiol, and OVX rats treated with 0.3 and 1.0 g/kg/day YJ for 12 weeks. Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) and bone microarchitecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. The effects of YJ on osteoblast and osteoclast formation were also investigated in an in vitro model using primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and murine calvarial preosteoblasts. mRNA expression of osteoclast differentiation-related genes was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: The decrease of BMD and destruction of bone microarchitecture were significantly reduced in the OVX-induced osteoporosis rat model after 12 weeks of YJ treatment. The anti-osteoporotic effect of YJ on bone loss was due to inhibition of osteoclast differentiation through down-regulation of the NF-kappaB pathway. In addition, YJ suppressed the induction of nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 and c-Fos following receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that YJ possess potent anti-osteoporotic activity in OVX rats and may be a useful remedy for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

21977865|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Yinchenhao Decoction (see text) for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in rats and study the mechanism. METHODS: Total 18 male SD rats were randomly divided into a normal control group, a model group and a treatment group, 6 rats in each group. Rats in the model and treatment groups were fed with high-fat forage for 10 weeks to prepare the NASH model, and the rats in the treatment group were administrated with Yinchenhao Decoction from the 6th week for 5 weeks. All rats were sacrificed at the end of the 10th week and the samples were collected. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) level, and hepatic triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) contents were determined. Hepatic pathological changes were detected by HE staining. RESULTS: Serum ALT activity, TNF-alpha level, hepatic TG and FFA contents, and the fatty deposition in hepatocytes were significantly reduced in the rats of the treatment group. CONCLUSION: Yinchenhao Decoction has good therapeutic effects for NASH, protecting the liver function and reducing the fatty deposition in liver, which are possibly related with reduction of FFA content and inhibition of TNF-alpha expression.

16173931|t|Sheng mai san, a Chinese herbal medicine, protects against renal ischaemic injury during heat stroke in the rat.
16173931|a|1. There is evidence that the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and peroxynitrite by ischaemia/reperfusion may lead to renal cell injury. Herein, we investigated whether Sheng mai san (SMS), a Chinese herbal medicine, protects against renal ischaemic injury during heat stroke by reducing iNOS-dependent nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite formation. 2. Urethane-anaesthetized rats were exposed to heat stress (ambient temperature 43 degrees C) to induce heat stroke. Control rats were exposed to 24 degrees C. Mean arterial pressure and renal blood flow after the onset of heat stroke were significantly lower in heat stroke rats than in control rats. However, both colonic temperature and renal damage score were greater in heat stroke rats compared with control rats. Similarly, plasma NO, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as the renal immunoreactivity of iNOS and peroxynitrite, were significantly higher in heat stroke rats compared with their normothermic controls. 3. Pretreatment with SMS (1.2 g/day per rat for 7 consecutive days before the initiation of heat stress) significantly attenuated the heat stroke-induced arterial hypotension, hyperthermia, renal ischaemia and damage, the increased renal immunoreactivity of iNOS and peroxynitrite and the increased plasma levels of NO, creatinine and BUN. Pretreatment with SMS resulted in a prolongation of survival time in heat stroke. 4. The results of the present study suggest that SMS protects against renal ischaemic damage by reducing iNOS-dependent NO and peroxynitrite production during heat stroke.

29728022|t|[Correlation analysis of "compound-target-pathway" of Yinchenhao decoction for cirrhosis based on computed prediction].
29728022|a|Chinese medicine prescription is the main form and means to treat diseases in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, the disjointing situation is generally present between "systemic" and "local", "macro" and "micro", "in vivo process" and "activity evaluation" in the study of TCM at present. An urgent task for the modernization of TCM is to establish new strategies and methods which can reflect the overall characteristics of TCM. The introduction of integrative pharmacology provided a feasible approach to solve the problem of the fragmentation of TCM. Internet-based computation platform method was adopted in this study to explore the active molecular mechanism of Yinchenhao decoction in the treatment of cirrhosis. Based on the analysis of the functional integration of Internet-based Computation Platform V1.0 version software, the "core components-key target- main pathway" multidimensional network of Yinchenhao decoction in treatment of cirrhosis disease was constructed to explore the potential molecular mechanism of Yinchenhao decoction in treatment of cirrhosis from multiple perspectives. The molecular mechanism analysis of Yinchenhao decoction showed that Yinchenhao decoction can achieve the therapeutic effect on cirrhosis and the mechanism might be associated with oxidative phosphorylation, energy metabolism, circulatory system, glycerophospholipid metabolis, lipid metabolism and other pathways. Yinchenhao decoction in treatment of cirrhosis may be associated with energy metabolism and lipid metabolism.

11995955|t|Effects of Choto-san on hemorheological factors and vascular function in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.
11995955|a|Choto-san is a formula used for the treatment of headache and vertigo. Recently it has often also been used for hypertension and dementia. One of the mechanisms involved is thought to be the improvement of blood circulation, but the details are still unclear. In this study, the effect of Chotosan was studied on nitric oxide (NO) function, hemorheological factors and endothelial function in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP). Rats were given Choto-san in drinking water for eight weeks. Body weight, blood pressure, serum NO2-/NO3-, lipid peroxides, blood viscosity, erythrocyte deformability and endothelium-dependent/-independent relaxation were measured. The results indicated that Choto-san caused a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in erythrocyte deformability and NO function. Blood viscosity was not changed. Furthermore, endothelium-dependent relaxation by acetylcholine was significantly increased as compared to control. In this study, it was supposed that Choto-san had a protective effect on the endothelium. SHR-SP is a useful model for human brain stroke, and Choto-san showed a protective effect against cerebral vascular injury in the susceptible rat.

32050950|t|A bioinformatics investigation into the pharmacological mechanisms of the effect of the Yinchenhao decoction on hepatitis C based on network pharmacology.
32050950|a|BACKGROUND: Globally, more than 170 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus, a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The Yinchenhao Decoction (YCHD) is a classic formula comprising three herbal medicines. This decoction have long been used in China for clinically treating acute and chronic infectious hepatitis and other liver and gallbladder damp heat-accumulation disorders. METHODS: In this study, we identified 32 active ingredients and 200 hepatitis C proteins and established a compound-predicted target network and a hepatitis C protein-protein interaction network by using Cytoscape 3.6.1. Then, we systematically analyzed the potential targets of the YCHD for the treatment of hepatitis C. Finally, molecular docking was applied to verify the key targets. In addition, we analyzed the mechanism of action of the predicted targets by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and gene ontology analyses. RESULTS: This study adopted a network pharmacology approach, mainly comprising target prediction, network construction, module detection, functional enrichment analysis, and molecular docking to systematically investigate the mechanisms of action of the YCHD in hepatitis C. The targets of the YCHD in the treatment of hepatitis C mainly involved PIK3CG, CASP3, BCL2, CASP8, and MMP1. The module and pathway enrichment analyses showed that the YCHD had the potential to influence varieties of biological pathways, including the TNF signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and pathways in cancer, that play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C. CONCLUSION: The results of this study preliminarily verified the basic pharmacological effects and related mechanisms of the YCHD in the treatment of hepatitis C.

19960982|t|[Effect of sijunzi decoction on the intestinal flora disturbance in two rat models of Pi-deficiency syndrome].
19960982|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of intestinal microflora in two rat models of Pi-deficiency syndrome (PDS) to study the effect of Sijunzi Decoction (SJZD) on intestinal microflora alteration (IMA). METHODS: Wistar rats allocated in Group A and B were established into two kinds of PDS models by Folium Sennae and Radix et Rhizoma Rhei respectively. Fecal samples were collected from the model rats at three phases, i. e. before modeling, after modeling and after treated with SJZD. Total DNA of microbial communities in them was extracted and amplified with ERIC-PCR to generate fingerprints for reflect the intestinal microflora configuration. Shannon-Weaver index (H') was used to analyze the diversity of rats' intestinal microflora, Sorenson pairwise similarity coefficient (Cs) was used to compare the similarity of different ERIC-PCR fingerprints, and Student's t test was used for analyzing the statistical significance of their differences. RESULTS: The intestinal microflora in both groups obviously changed after modeling and recovered to the primary level after treated with SJZD. The H' of the ERIC-PCR fingerprints at the three phases was 2.20 +/- 0.12, 2.00 +/- 0.10 and 2.27 +/- 0.10 in Group A, and 2.09 +/- 0.02, 1.88 +/- 0.10 and 1.94 +/- 0.10 in Group B respectively, both showing significant differences among different phases (P<0.05). Accumulative curves of Cs showed that the proportion of Cs accounting for less than 60% was 0 in Group A and 19% in Group B before modeling, 75% and 52% for them respectively after modeling, and 4% and 24% after rehabilitation with SJZD. CONCLUSION: The H' of intestinal microflora in the two kinds of PDS models were significantly lowered, and could be recovered to the normal level by SJZD treatment (P<0.05). ERIC-PCR fingerprints can be used as a bio-criterion for evaluating intestinal microflora in patients with PDS.

33919176|t|The Herbal Formula CWBSD Improves Sleep Quality Dependent on Oral Microbial Type and Tongue Diagnostic Features in Insomnia.
33919176|a|Cheonwangbosim-dan (CWBSD) is a traditional Korean herb formula that has been widely prescribed for insomnia patients with a heart-yin deficiency (HYD) pattern. Several studies have reported that heart function and insomnia are interrelated, and few have explored associations between insomnia, oral microbiota, and tongue diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of CWBSD on primary insomnia, tongue diagnosis, and oral microbiota. At baseline, 56 patients with primary insomnia were assigned to two groups, a HYD group and a non-HYD (NHYD) group and they took CWBSD for 6 weeks. During the study, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Indices (PSQIs) and Insomnia Severity Indices (ISIs) decreased significantly in both groups. However, the PSQI reduction observed in the HYD group was greater than in the NHYD group and sleep times increased only in the HYD group. As sleep quality improved, the amount of tongue coating increased at the posterior tongue, where heart function appears. At baseline, the HYD and NHYD group had a specific oral microbiota (Veillonella at genus level), but no significant change was observed after taking CWBSD. Additionally, subjects were divided into two oral microbiota types ("orotypes"). The genera Prevotella, Veillonella, or Neisseria were abundant in each orotype. The reduction in PSQI in orotype 1 during the 6-week treatment period was greater than in orotype 2. In conclusion, this study shows that CWBSD could be used to treat primary insomnia in patients with a HYD pattern as determined using tongue diagnosis and oral microbiota distributional patterns.

3264299|t|Protective effect of a traditional Chinese medicine, xiao-chai-hu-tang (Japanese name: shosaiko-to), on Listeria monocytogenes infection in mice.
3264299|a|Lethal effect of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) in mice was prevented by an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, xiao-chai-hu-tang (Japanese name: shosaiko-to), 4 days before ip bacterial infection. The numbers of bacteria in the peritoneal cavity and liver were smaller in shosaiko-to-treated mice from one day after the infection. Macrophage accumulation in the peritoneal cavity after ip inoculation of L. monocytogenes was observed in both untreated and shosaiko-to-treated mice. Although rates of such increases were almost the same between both groups, the absolute number of macrophages was larger in shosaiko-to-treated than in untreated mice because of a higher level of the macrophage number at 4 days after ip injection of shosaiko-to. In untreated mice, bactericidal activity of peritoneal macrophages decreased from one day to 3 days after ip injection of killed L. monocytogenes. Such an activity was maintained at the same level from 1 to 3 days in shosaiko-to-treated mice. Augmented accumulation of macrophages and maintenance of their bactericidal activity may be main mechanisms of the augmented resistance in shosaiko-to-treated mice. Augmented resistance against bacterial growth in the thigh muscle in ip shosaiko-to-treated mice may be caused by such mechanisms. The effect of shosaiko-to observed at an early stage of infection may be T cell-independent, since such an effect was observed in athymic nude mice and delayed footpad reaction could not be detected at such a timing in euthymic normal mice.

34426178|t|Hepatic protective effects of Shenling Baizhu powder, a herbal compound, against inflammatory damage via TLR4/NLRP3 signalling pathway in rats with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
34426178|a|OBJECTIVE: High-fat diet (HFD) and inflammation are two key contributors to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Shenling Baizhu powder (SLBZP), a classical herbal compound, has been successfully used to alleviate NAFLD. However, its specific mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we assessed the anti-NAFLD effect of SLBZP in vivo. METHODS: Rats were fed an HFD with or without SLBZP or with probiotics. At the end of week 16, an echo magnetic resonance imaging (EchoMRI) body composition analyser was used to quantitatively analyse body composition; a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging system was used to evaluate whole body and liver fat; and the Moor full-field laser perfusion imager 2 was used to assess liver microcirculation, after which, all rats were sacrificed. Then, biochemical indicators in the blood and the ultrastructure of rat livers were evaluated. Protein expression related to the liver Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) signalling pathway was assessed using Western blot analysis. Further, high-throughput screening of 29 related inflammatory factors in liver tissue was performed using a cytokine array. RESULTS: SLBZP supplementation reduced body weight, serum free fatty acid, and insulin resistance index (P < 0.05). It also ameliorated liver microcirculation and ultrastructural abnormalities. EchoMRI and micro-CT quantitative analyses showed that treatment with SLBZP reduced fat mass and visceral fat (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). In addition, SLBZP decreased the expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated TLR4/NLRP3 signalling pathway-related proteins and altered the expression levels of some inflammatory cytokines in liver tissues. CONCLUSION: SLBZP can inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1beta release by suppressing LPS-induced TLR4 expression in rats with HFD-induced NAFLD. Thus, SLBZP may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory damage and associated diseases.

2167654|t|Inhibitory effects of kampo medicine on Epstein-Barr virus antigen induction by tumor promoter.
2167654|a|We have investigated the possible interaction of Japanese Kampo medicine; Shosaiko-to with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induction by TPA (12-O-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate) in EBV-genome harboring cells. The effect of ether extract of Shosaiko-to was also studied on the induction of EBV by superinfection with EBV from P3HR-1 cells (P3H-EBV). Concomitant treatment of EBV-latently-infected cells (Raji and A2L/AH) with TPA and ether extract resulted in effective inhibition of EBV-antigen induction. However, in the experiments to test the influence of ether extract on EBV induction by superinfecting Raji cells with P3H-EBV, ether extract did not affect the percentage of EBV-antigen-positive cells. These data indicate that Shosaiko-to is effective to inhibit antigen synthesis induced by chemical promoters without affecting EBV-antigen induction after superinfection.

22005564|t|[Platelet parameters and platelet Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in patients with sepsis, and the effect of a joint treatment-plan integrating traditional Chinese and western medicine: a clinical study].
22005564|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of a treatment regimen combining modern (Western) medication and a traditional Chinese medicinal recipe Modified Liang-Ge San on sepsis, and its effect on platelet parameters/activation, platelet TLR4 expression and the intensity of inflammatory response in the patients. METHODS: 64 patients with sepsis were randomly assigned to two groups (32 each) to receive Western therapy only (group X) and Western therapy + Modified Liang-Ge San (group L). The values of: platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), the expression of TLR4 and procaspase activating compound-1 (PAC-1) in platelets, plasma concentration of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were collected on the day of admission, and 3, 5, 9 days after treatment. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU), bleeding events and 28 day mortality in these patients were also analyzed. A group of 15 healthy volunteers (group C) were used as control. RESULTS: Compared to group C, the patients with sepsis have significantly: lower PLT (x10 9/L: 211.37+/-77.84 vs. 272.33+/-34.23, P< 0.01 ), increased MPV (fL: 10.24+/-0.81 vs. 9.64+/-0.66, P< 0.05) and PDW (fL: 17.79+/-1.68 vs. 15.61+/-1.54, P< 0.01), up-regulated platelet TLR4 [(39.93+/-9.07)% vs. (23.50+/-4.68)%] and PAC-1 expression [(42.21+/-8.74)% vs. (21.02+/-3.49)%], both P < 0.01, and higher level of sCD40L (mug/L: 6.94+/-1.05 vs. 3.27+/-0.41)and TNF-alpha(ng/L: 60.10+/-9.77 vs. 4.08+/-3.08), both P< 0.01. Compared to group X, group L had significantly (P< 0.05 or P< 0.01, respectively) lower value in: creatinine (mumol/L: 106.2+/-34.4 vs. 127.5+/-43.7); alanine aminotransferase (U/L: 31.7+/-12.5 vs. 41.9+/-19.9);aspartate aminotransferase (U/L: 54.1+/-21.6 vs. 68.5+/-24.1); TLR4 [(27.14+/-6.08)% vs. (30.92+/-5.47)%]; PAC-1 [(27.52+/-6.51)% vs. (31.24+/-5.77)%]; sCD40L (3.86+/-0.69 vs. 4.38+/-0.73); TNF-alpha (22.06+/-7.19 vs. 28.25+/-8.99), and higher PLT (261.93+/-55.32 vs. 231.37+/-63.58, P< 0.05), in the 9 days after treatment. In patients with sepsis, platelet PAC-1 expression correlated significantly to PLT ( r = - 0.409, P< 0.01 ) negatively, and MPV, PDW, platelet TLR4 expression, plasma sCD40L ( r (1) = 0.262, r (2) = 0.318, r (3) = 0.341, r(3) = 0.519, all P< 0.01) positively; sCD40L and TNF-alpha was positively correlated ( r = 0.542, P < 0.01 ) in these patients. In comparison with group X, the length of stay in ICU (day: 8.06+/-2.86 vs. 9.31+/-2.48), the incidence of bleeding (12.5% vs. 21.9%) and APACHE II score (12.75+/- 4.56 vs. 14.59+/- 3.97) were significantly lower (all P< 0.05) in group L on the 9 days after treatment. No significant difference was found in 28 day mortality between group L and X (15.63% vs. 18.75%, P> 0.05). CONCLUSION: In patients with sepsis, platelet TLR4 expression is elevated together with platelet activation. The joint application of Western medicine and Modified Liang-Ge San may suppress such up-regulation in TLR4/other inflammatory mediators, and alleviate platelet activation/thrombocytopenia in these patients.

27034700|a|In this experiment, we used streptozotocin (STZ) to establish a model of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) rats, where Zuogui Wan was given to GDM rats. After pregnancy, offspring rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, high fat and sugar as the control group, GDM group, and Zuogui Wan GDM group. Rats in high fat and sugar as the control group, GDM group, and Zuogui Wan GDM group were fed with high fat and sugar diet. Rats in control group were fed the basic diet. The means of 2hPG were higher than 7.8 mmol.L(-1) and lower than 11.1 mmol.L(-1) on the rats of GDM group on week 15, and IGT models were successful. Body weight, abdominal fat weight, the ratio of abdominal fat weight and body weight, fasting plasma glucose, 2hPG, insulin, leptin, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) of Zuogui Wan GDM group were significantly lower than GDM group. The level of adiponectin in Zuogui Wan GDM group was significantly higher than GDM group.

27880884|t|Anti-atherosclerosis and cardio-protective effects of the Angong Niuhuang Pill on a high fat and vitamin D3 induced rodent model of atherosclerosis.
27880884|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Angong Niuhuang Pill (ANP) is a well known Chinese traditional therapeutic for the treatment for diseases affecting the Central Nervous System (CNS). Components of the ANP formulation, including Bovis Calculus Sativus, Pulvis Bubali Comus Concentratus, Moschus, Margarita, Cinnabaris, Realgar, Coptidis Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Gardeniae Fructus, Curcumae Radix, and Bomeolum Syntheticum, have been used for the treatment of stroke, encephalitis and emergency meningitis across Asia, especially in China for hundreds of years. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the anti-atherosclerosis and cardio-protective effects of ANP administration using a rodent model of atherosclerosis induced by a high fat and vitamin D3. METHODS: Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) 78 male SD rats were randomly divided into a control group and 5 atherosclerotic model groups. The atherosclerotic groups were divided to receive either Simvastatin (SVTT, 0.005g/kg), Low-dose ANP (0.125g/kg), Medium-dose ANP (0.25g/kg), and High-dose ANP (0.5g/kg). Following adaptive feeding for one week, atherosclerosis was induced and the atherosclerosis model was established. Experimental drugs (either simvastatin or ANP) or normal saline were administered intragastrically once daily for 9 weeks starting from the 8th week. A carotid artery ultrasound was performed at the 17th week to determine whether atherosclerosis had been induced. After the atherosclerosis model was successfully established, platelet aggregation rates, serum biochemical indices, apoptosis-related Bcl-2, Bax proteins levels in the heart were assayed. Pathological and histological analysis was completed using artery tissue from different experimental different groups to assess the effects of ANP. RESULTS: ANP signi fi cantly decreased aortic membrane thickness, the maximum platelet aggregation rates, and the ratio of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). In addition, ANP signi fi cantly reduced serum contents of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, troponin I, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. ANP markedly improved abnormal pathological conditions of the aorta and heart, and helped to prevent myocardial apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that ANP has robust ant-atherosclerosis and cardio-protective effects on a high-fat and vitamin D3 - induced rodent model of atherosclerosis due to its antiplatelet aggregation, lipid regulatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties.

30254408|t|Daikenchuto (Da-Jian-Zhong-Tang) ameliorates intestinal fibrosis by activating myofibroblast transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 channel.
30254408|a|AIM: To investigate the anti-fibrotic effects of the traditional oriental herbal medicine Daikenchuto (DKT) associated with transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels in intestinal myofibroblasts. METHODS: Inflammatory and fibrotic changes were detected in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) chronic colitis model of wild-type and TRPA1-knockout (TRPA1-KO) mice via pathological staining and immunoblotting analysis. Ca(2+) imaging experiments examined the effects of DKT and its components/ingredients on intestinal myofibroblast (InMyoFib) cell TRPA1 channel function. Pro-fibrotic factors and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-associated signaling were tested in an InMyoFib cell line by qPCR and immunoblotting experiments. Samples from non-stenotic and stenotic regions of the intestines of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were used for pathological analysis. RESULTS: Chronic treatment with TNBS caused more severe inflammation and fibrotic changes in TRPA1-KO than in wild-type mice. A one-week enema administration of DKT reduced fibrotic lesions in wild-type but not in TRPA1-KO mice. The active ingredients of DKT, i.e., hydroxy alpha-sanshool and 6-shogaol, induced Ca(2+) influxes in InMyoFib, and this was antagonized by co-treatment with a selective TRPA1 channel blocker, HC-030031. DKT counteracted TGF-beta1-induced expression of Type I collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), which were accompanied by a reduction in the phosphorylation of Smad-2 and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) and the expression of myocardin. Importantly, 24-h incubation with a DKT active component Japanese Pepper increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of TRPA1 in InMyoFibs, which in turn negatively regulated collagen synthesis. In the stenotic regions of the intestines of CD patients, TRPA1 expression was significantly enhanced. CONCLUSION: The effects of DKT on the expression and activation of the TRPA1 channel could be advantageous for suppressing intestinal fibrosis, and benefit inflammatory bowel disease treatment.

32049834|t|Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction for treating cervical radiculopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
32049834|a|BACKGROUND: Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction (HGWD) is a common prescription for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy (CR). And the effectiveness and safety of HGWD for CR were assessed in this study. METHODS: Seven databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials involving HGWD alone or HGWD combined with conventional treatment were enrolled. The authors in pairs independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. RESULTS: Eight studies involving 783 participants with CR were included. Meta-analysis revealed that the efficacy of HGWD for CR was significantly superior compared with control treatment (risk ratio = 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.06-1.19, Z = 3.71; P = .0002). Compare with control group, there is an increase in visual analog scale (mean difference [MD] = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.83-1.14; Z = 12.57; P < .00001). There was also an improvement of neck disability index (MD = 9.2; 95% CI: 8.28-10.11; Z = 19.75; P < .00001). Adverse events were not mentioned in the 8 trials. CONCLUSION: HGWD alone or HGWD plus other treatment may be helpful to patients with CR. However, the methodological quality of the randomized controlled trials was generally low. Larger and better-designed randomized controlled trials are recommended.

30551379|t|Zhen-wu-tang attenuates Adriamycin-induced nephropathy via regulating AQP2 and miR-92b.
30551379|a|Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and edema. The disorder of sodium and water metabolism is a critical mechanism regulating the origination and progression of NS. Zhen-wu-tang (ZWT) has been traditionally used to treat edema disease in China and Japan. The present study was carried out to assess the protective effect of ZWT in Adriamycin-induced (ADR) NS rats and investigate the potential anti-NS mechanisms of ZWT. We found that ZWT treatment ameliorate impaired kidney function and regulate water balance of kidney. Importantly, ZWT increased the expression of Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) which play key roles in maintaining body water homeostasis. Additionally, we determined miRNAs expression patterns in NS rats. Using bioinformatics prediction and miR-92b mimic or inhibitor in vitro, we identified miR-92b as a possible modulator of AQP2. Also we found that ZWT can decrease the expression of miR-92b and reverse the effect of miR-92b on AQP2 in vitro. We further demonstrated that miR-92b directly regulated AQP2 expression by targeting 3'-UTR of AQP2. These finding suggest that ZWT may reduce renal edema in Adriamycin-induced nephropathy via regulating AQP2 and miR-92b.

31236126|t|Protective Effects of Angong Niuhuang Pill on Early Atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) Mice by Reducing the Inflammatory Response.
31236126|a|Atherosclerosis (AS) is the primary cause of cardiocerebrovascular disease, and inflammation is responsible for the initiation of its pathogenesis. Therefore, targeting inflammatory pathways to prevent AS progression is an ideal strategy. Angong Niuhuang pill (ANP) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine and has been widely used for thousands of years to treat central nervous system and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated the role of ANP in reducing inflammation during early AS, using a high-fat diet-induced ApoE(-/-) mouse model of AS. Compared to those with simvastatin, ANP had no significant effect on serum triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein levels. However, it effectively inhibited splenic and vascular inflammation. This agent also reduced the Th17/CD4(+)T ratio and mRNA expression of IL-6 and increased the Treg/CD4(+)T ratio and mRNA expression of TGF-beta1. Thus, ANP restored Th17/Treg homeostasis in the spleen. It also regulated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in the aorta in a similar manner. Further, it downregulated the expression of chemokine receptors (CCR2, CXCR3), their ligands (MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3), and cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1) in arterial vessels. These results indicate that ANP can ameliorate the development of early AS, mainly by reducing inflammation instead of acting as an antihyperlipidemic drug.

11311321|t|Immunological restoration and anti-tumor effect by Japanese herbal medicine in aged mice.
11311321|a|We examined the effect of two Japanese herbal medicines (Kampo-Hozai) on immunological functions and anti-tumor activity in old mice. Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41) was remarkably effective in the restoration of impaired immune functions of old mice, in terms of number of T cells and NK cells, and anti-SRBC antibody response, while it was not effective in enhancing immune functions of young mice. Juzen-taiho-to was also effective in increasing the number of T cells, remarkably, and NK cells, slightly, in the aged mice. While a significant increase was not observed in young mice. NK activity increased both in young and old mice with the treatment of TJ-48. A significant decrease was observed in metastatic pulmonary colonies of B16 melanoma cells both in young and old mice treated with Juzen-taiho-to for 16 weeks. These results suggested that some of Japanese herbal medicines were useful in restoration of impaired immune functions of old mice and could be recommended for human elderly.

31341898|t|Jiedu Granule Combined with Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization and Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in Treating Hepatocellular Carcinoma with Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus.
31341898|a|BACKGROUND: The potential advantages of Jiedu granule (a compound Chinese herbal medicine) combined therapeutic strategies compared with non-Jiedu granule therapeutic strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) remain unclear. Thus, the purpose of the study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of Jiedu granule for HCC with PVTT. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 190 patients (94 for non-Jiedu and 96 for Jiedu) with HCC and PVTT from March 2012 to October 2016. Patients were followed up by outpatient examination and telephone till November 2018. RESULTS: It was statistically insignificant between the two groups in baseline characteristics. Procedure-related adverse events (AEs) were observed and compared and most of them were not serious which were easily controlled or subsided naturally. No AE-induced death happened. The median overall survival (OS) rates in the single TACE plus GKR and Jiedu granule combined group were 11.3 months (95% CI: 9.168-13.435) and 15.8 months (95% CI: 13.244-18.339), respectively (p = 0.00047). CONCLUSIONS: Jiedu granule combined with TACE plus GKR is safe in HCC patients with PVTT and this Chinese herbal medicine is worthy to be promoted because of better prognosis which needs further research.

19996156|t|A clinical trial of kampo formulae for the treatment of symptoms of yusho, a poisoning caused by dioxins and related organochlorine compounds.
19996156|a|The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional herbal medicines (Kampo) on the symptoms of Yusho. Yusho is a mass food poisoning that was caused by ingestion of rice oil contaminated with dioxins and related organochlorines in 1968. Patients with Yusho suffer from skin symptoms (acneform eruptions, liability to suppuration and pigmentation), respiratory symptoms (cough and expectoration of sputum), neurological symptoms (numbness and paresthesia of extremities), arthralgia and general fatigue, and no effective treatment has yet been developed. In this clinical trial, four Kampo formulae (Bakumondo-to, Keigai-rengyo-to, Gosha-jinki-gan and Hochu-ekki-to) were administered to four representative Yusho symptoms (respiratory, skin, neurological symptoms and general fatigue), respectively. Twenty-seven Yusho patients were enrolled and two formulae were administered to each patient for half-a-year each. The effectiveness of Kampo formulae was estimated by changes in the intensity of symptoms measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 100 mm recorded at baseline and after administration of each formula. The influence of Kampo formulae on patients' quality of life (QOL) was also assessed by the SF-36 (NBS). Twenty-five patients completed the treatment. Bakumondo-to significantly improved respiratory symptoms as well as patients' QOL in the context of vitality, compared with other formulae. In contrast, Hochu-ekki-to impaired patients' QOL in the context of physical functioning and vitality, compared with other formulae. This study demonstrated for the first time that a Kampo formula Bakumondo-to is useful for treating respiratory symptoms caused by dioxins.

23920247|t|Fuzi-Lizhong pill compensates hypothyroid-hypothermia via ghrelin release.
23920247|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Fuzi-Lizhong pill (FLZ) is a traditional Chinese medicine for treating patients with Spleen Yang deficient syndrome. Ghrelin, a peptide with 28 amino acid residues, plays multiple roles in thermogenesis. This study aims to explore FLZ regulating ghrelin to compensate hypothermia in rats with hypothyroid and indigestion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In litter-matched rats, hypothermia was developed with both thyroidectomy at d1 and interscapular brown adipose (IBA) removal at d42, indigestion was induced with both high fat diet and fasting-feeding cycle from d56; the littermates with hypothermia and indigestion were administrated with FLZ from d70. Adaptive thermogenesis, thyroid hormones, metabolites, ghrelin dynamics were measured at d98. RESULTS: The results showed that plasma ghrelin levels were inversely correlated with the gastric ghrelin levels and adaptive thermogenesis in rats undergone both thyroidectomy and IBA removal. Fatty diet and FLZ enhanced the increase of plasma ghrelin of hypothyroid rats. These were supported by the changes of plasma thyroid related hormones, plasma metabolites, gastric ghrelin mRNA and protein, and the effects of fatty diet or FLZ. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that more ghrelin release compensate chronic hypothermia in rats with both hypothyroidism and indigestion. It could explain the mechanisms of FLZ in relieving chronic hypothermia.

24140602|t|Shenghua Decoction reduces uterine bleeding and regulates T-cell paradigm in human deciduas of RU486 medical abortion.
24140602|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Excessive uterine bleeding is the most common and problematic side effect of RU486 medical abortion. Shenghua Decoction (SHD) is a well-known traditional Chinese herbal prescription for reducing uterine bleeding induced by RU486 medical abortion. However, its therapeutic mechanism still remains unclear. The Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm plays an important role in achieving maternal-fetal immunotolerance and its bias participates in RU486-induced abortion. Our previous research on mice demonstrated that the uterine bleeding volume is negatively related to the proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells whereas positively related to the proportions of Th2 and Treg cells. Additionally, Th1-type cytokine inducing effect was identified in our previous study. Therefore, it was hypothesized that SHD reduced the uterine bleeding in RU486 medical abortion by inducing Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm bias. The purpose of this study was to determine the regulatory effect and the mechanism of SHD on human decidual Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm for alleviating uterine bleeding in RU486 medical abortion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 90 women within seven weeks of a normal intrauterine pregnancy, who elected for termination of pregnancy, were divided into three groups; vacuum aspiration group, RU486 group, and SHD-RU486 group. Duration of uterine bleeding was recorded and volume of uterine bleeding was measured by the method of alkaline hematin photometric. To determine the regulatory effect of SHD on Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm, the proportions of Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg cells in the decidua of different groups were analyzed using a FACS calibur. Correlation was analyzed in order to demonstrate the relationship between the Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm and the uterine bleeding in RU486 medical abortion. Moreover, to elucidate the mechanism underlying the T-cell paradigm regulating of SHD, the mRNA and protein expressions of subset-specific transcription factors (T-bet, GATA-3, RORgammat, and Foxp3) for the differentiation of Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm in human decidual CD4(+) T cells were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and western blot analysis respectively. Moreover, the mRNA expression of the characteristic cytokines of Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm (IFNgamma, IL-4, IL-17A, TGF-beta) were analyzed by RT-PCR assay. RESULT: Compared with RU486 group, both the uterine bleeding volume and duration reduced significantly in SHD-RU486 group. Both the duration and the volume of the uterine bleeding demonstrated negative correlation with the proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells, whereas showed positive correlation with Th2 and Treg cells. SHD increased the proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells whereas decreased those of Th2 and Treg cells. Thus, the ratios of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg cells elevated markedly after SHD treatment. SHD promoted the mRNA as well as the protein expressions of subset-specific transcription factors for the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 subsets (T-bet and RORgammat) while inhibited those of Th2 and Treg cells (GATA-3 and Foxp3). Moreover, the mRNA expression of Th1- and Th17- type cytokines (IFNgamma and IL-17A) was up-regulated while that of Th2-type and Treg-produced cytokines (IL-4 and TGF-beta) was down-regulated significantly after SHD administration. CONCLUSION: Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm bias was involved in RU486 medical abortion. SHD reduced the uterine bleeding efficiently by inducing Th1 and Th17 skews in the maternal-fetal of RU486 medical abortion patients. The regulatory effect of SHD on Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm in RU486 medical abortion is attributed to the modulation of transcription and protein expression of subset-specific transcription factors for T-cell subsets differentiation and their characteristic cytokines.

32417423|t|Mechanism of Huang-lian-Jie-du decoction and its effective fraction in alleviating acute ulcerative colitis in mice: Regulating arachidonic acid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism.
32417423|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huang-lian-Jie-du decoction (HLJDD) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription for clearing away heat, purging fire and detoxifying, which can be used to treat sepsis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and gastrointestinal diseases. Our previous studies have shown that HLJDD can effectively alleviate acute ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice, and its n-butanol fraction (HLJDD-NBA) is the effective fraction. The aim of this study is to further investigate the mechanism of HLJDD and HLJDD-NBA in relieving UC in mice from a holistic perspective. METHODS: The acute UC model of BABL/c mice was induced by 3.5% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate drinking water. At the same time of modeling, HLJDD and HLJDD-NBA were given orally for treatment respectively. During the experiment, the clinical symptoms of mice were recorded and the physiological and biochemical indexes of mice were detected after the experiment. In addition, the plasma metabolites of mice in each group were detected and analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis method. Then, the potential target metabolic pathway of drug intervention was screened through the enrichment analysis of differential metabolites. Finally, we use molecular simulation docking technology to further explore the molecular regulatory mechanism of HLJDD and HLJDD-NBA on potential target metabolic pathways. RESULTS: HLJDD and HLJDD-NBA intervention can significantly reduce the disease activity index of UC mice, inhibit colon length shortening and pathological damage, and relieve the abnormal changes of physiological and biochemical parameters of UC mice. Moreover, HLJDD and HLJDD-NBA can significantly inhibit the metabolic dysfunction of UC mice by reversing the abnormal changes of 24 metabolites in UC mice, and the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway are the target metabolic pathways regulated by them. Further literature review and molecular simulation docking analysis showed that HLJDD and HLJDD-NBA may inhibit the disorder of arachidonic acid metabolism pathway and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway by inhibiting COX-2 protein expression and PLA2, 5-LOX activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments revealed that HLJDD and HLJDD-NBA can alleviate UC of mice by regulating arachidonic acid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism, which points out the direction for further research and development of HLJDD as a new anti-ulcer drug.

34070764|t|Effect of You-Gui-Wan on House Dust Mite-Induced Mouse Allergic Asthma via Regulating Amino Acid Metabolic Disorder and Gut Dysbiosis.
34070764|a|Chinese herbal remedies have long been used for enhancing immunity and treating asthma. However, the evidence-based efficacy remains to be supported. This study aimed to explore the potential bio-signatures in allergic asthma and the effect of You-Gui-Wan (YGW), a traditional Chinese herbal prescription, on dust mite-induced mouse allergic asthma. Extract of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p), a dust mite, was intratracheally administered to induce allergic asthma in mice. Serum metabolomic and 16S rRNA-based microbiome profiling were used to analyze untargeted metabolites with levels significantly changed and gut microbiota composition, respectively. Results indicated that 10 metabolites (acetylcarnitine, carnitine, hypoxanthine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, norleucine, isoleucine, betaine, methionine, and valine), mainly associated with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, aromatic amino acid (AAA) biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism were markedly elevated after Der p treatment. YGW administration reversed the levels for 7 of the 10 identified metabolites, chiefly affecting BCAA metabolism. On 16S DNA sequencing, disordered Der p-induced gut microbiota was significantly alleviated by YGW. Multiple correlation analysis showed a good correlation between gut microbiota composition and levels of selected metabolites. Our study showed YGW administration effectively alleviated BCAA metabolic disorder and improved gut dysbiosis. This study provides support for YGW administration with benefits for allergic asthma.

21435368|t|Evaluation of hepatotoxicity potential of cinnabar-containing An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan, a patent traditional Chinese medicine.
21435368|a|An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan (AGNH) is a patent traditional Chinese medicine for brain disorders. It contains 10% cinnabar (HgS). Hg is known to produce toxicity to the kidney, brain and liver. Is AGNH safe? Liver is a major organ for drug metabolism, whether the long-term use of AGNH would affect hepatic P450 enzymes is unknown. To address these concerns, mice were given orally cinnabar (300mg/kg), cinnabar-containing AGNH daily for 44days, and liver toxicity was examined and compared with that of methylmercury (MeHg, 2.6mg/kg) and mercuric chloride (HgCl(2), 32mg/kg). Serum aminotransferases were increased by MeHg and HgCl(2) only. Histopathology showed more severe liver damage in MeHg- and HgCl(2)-treated mice than in the cinnabar and AGNH groups. Accumulation of Hg in MeHg- and HgCl(2)-treated mice was 96- and 71-fold higher than controls, respectively, but was only 2-fold after cinnabar and AGNH administration. Expressions of metallothionein-1 and heme oxygenase-1, biomarkers for Hg toxicity, were increased by MeHg and HgCl(2,) but were not altered in cinnabar- and AGNH-treated mice. Expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 genes, such as Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1 and Cyp4a10 was increased only after MeHg and HgCl(2), and the expressions of Cyp3a11and Cyp3a25 were increased by all treatments, indicating the potential Hg-drug interactions after long-term use of cinnabar-containing traditional medicines. Taken together, the results demonstrate that AGNH is much less hepatotoxic than common mercurials, and that the use of total Hg content to evaluate the toxicity of cinnabar-containing traditional Chinese medicines appears to be inappropriate.

29556199|t|Exploring the Mechanism of Dangguiliuhuang Decoction Against Hepatic Fibrosis by Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation.
29556199|a|Dangguiliuhuang decoction (DGLHD) has been demonstrated to be effective in treating inflammatory, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. In the study, we tried to elucidate the pharmacological efficacy and mechanism of DGLHD against liver fibrosis and predicate potential active ingredients and targets via network analysis and experimental validation. In the formula, we totally discovered 76 potential active ingredients like baicalein, berberine, and wogonin, and 286 corresponding targets including PTGS (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) 2, PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) -gamma, and NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB). Pathway and functional enrichment analysis of these putative targets indicated that DGLHD obviously influenced NF-kappaB and PPAR signaling pathway. Consistently, DGLHD downregulated levels of ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST (aspartate transaminase), reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines-TNF (tumor necrosis factor) -alpha and IL (Interleukin) -1beta in serum and liver from mice with hepatic fibrosis, and inhibited hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-T6 cells proliferation. DGLHD decreased TGF (transforming growth factor) -beta1 and alpha-SMA (smooth muscle actin) expression as well, maintained MMP (matrix metalloprotein) 13-TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases) 1 balance, leading to mitigated ECM (extracellular matrix) deposition in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, our experimental data confirmed that the alleviated inflammation and ECM accumulation were pertinent to NF-kappaB inhibition and PPAR-gamma activation. Overall, our results suggest that DGLHD aims at multiply targets and impedes the progression of hepatic fibrosis by ameliorating abnormal inflammation and ECM deposition, thereby serving as a novel regimen for treating hepatic fibrosis in clinic.

16209265|t|[The protective effects of sini decoction on mitochondrial function in adriamycin-induced heart failure rats].
16209265|a|OBJECTIVE: The role of mitochondria in Adriamycin (ADR) -induced heart failure and the protective effects of Sini Decoction (SND) were investigated. METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into three groups, control group, heart failure group (model group) and SND group. ADR was injected in the rats of heart failure group and SND group by caudal vein. After injection, the rats in SND group were given SND (3.75/kg/d, p. o.). Three weeks later, cardiac function, mitochondrial swelling, content of malondialdehyde (MDA), activity of Mn SOD, Na+-K+ ATPase and Ca2+ ATPase were measured. The mRNA expression of Mn SOD was also detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared with model group, the cardiac function, the activity and the mRNA expression of Mn SOD and the activity of Na+-K+ ATPase and Ca2+ ATPase were significantly elevated, while the degree of mitochondria swelling and the content of MDA were reduced in SND-treated rats. CONCLUSION: The data suggests that oxidative stress is present in the mitochondria of myocardium in ADR-induced heart failure rats and it can be reduced by SND. The mechanism may be closely related to the protective effects on mitochondria.

7648990|t|Liver injuries induced by herbal medicine, syo-saiko-to (xiao-chai-hu-tang).
7648990|a|Four patients treated with the herbal medicine syo-saiko-to (xiao-chai-hu-tang) exhibited acute drug-induced liver injury. The latent period was one and a half to three months. All of the patients showed a rise in aminotransferases after readministration or challenge test. The liver histology revealed centrilobular confluent necrosis or spotty necrosis, microvesicular fatty change, acidophilic degeneration, and a granuloma. Cholestasis was seen in two patients. The results of the [13C]aminopyrine breath test, performed in one patient, were low before the challenge test and even lower after the challenge. These findings suggest that the herbal medicine syo-saiko-to may induce acute injury or the hepatocellular pattern with variable cholestasis.

28335476|t|Inhibition of Neoplastic Transformation and Chemically-Induced Skin Hyperplasia in Mice by Traditional Chinese Medicinal Formula Si-Wu-Tang.
28335476|a|Exploring traditional medicines may lead to the development of low-cost and non-toxic cancer preventive agents. Si-Wu-Tang (SWT), comprising the combination of four herbs, Rehmanniae, Angelica, Chuanxiong, and Paeoniae, is one of the most popular traditional Chinese medicines for women's diseases. In our previous studies, the antioxidant Nrf2 pathways were strongly induced by SWT in vitro and in vivo. Since Nrf2 activation has been associated with anticarcinogenic effects, the purpose of this study is to evaluate SWT's activity of cancer prevention. In the Ames test, SWT demonstrated an antimutagenic activity against mutagenicity induced by the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA). In JB6 P+ cells, a non-cancerous murine epidermal model for studying tumor promotion, SWT inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced neoplastic transformation. The luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that SWT suppressed EGF-induced AP-1 and TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, which are essential factors involved in skin carcinogenesis. In a DMBA-induced skin hyperplasia assay in 'Sensitivity to Carcinogenesis' (SENCAR) mice, both topical and oral SWT inhibited DMBA-induced epidermal hyperplasia, expression of the proliferation marker Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and H-ras mutations. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that SWT prevents tumor promoter and chemical-induced carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo, partly by inhibiting DNA damage and blocking the activation of AP-1 and NF-kappaB.

34511884|t|Integrating Network Pharmacology and Experimental Verification to Explore the Mechanism of Effect of Zuojin Pills in Pancreatic Cancer Treatment.
34511884|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant tumors worldwide. Zuojin pills (ZJP), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, which can treat a variety of cancers. However, the active compounds present in ZJP and the potential mechanisms through which ZJP acts against pancreatic cancer have not been thoroughly investigated. METHODS: Data on pancreatic cancer-related genes, bioactive compounds, and potential targets of ZJP were downloaded from public databases. Bioinformatics analysis, including protein-protein interaction (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, was conducted to identify important components, potential targets, and signaling pathways through which ZJP affects pancreatic cancer. The results of this analysis were verified by in vitro experiments. RESULTS: The network pharmacology analysis results showed that 41 compounds and 130 putative target genes of ZJP were associated with anti-pancreatic cancer effects. ZJP may exert its inhibitory effects against pancreatic cancer by acting on key targets such as JUN, TP53, and MAPK1. Moreover, KEGG analysis indicated that the anti-pancreatic cancer effect of ZJP was mediated by multiple pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT, IL-17, TNF, HIF-1, and P53 signaling pathways. Among these, the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which included the highest number of enriched genes, may play a more important role in treating pancreatic cancer. The in vitro results showed that ZJP significantly inhibits the cell cycle and cell proliferation through the PI3K/AKT/caspase pathway and that it can induce apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells, consistent with the results predicted by network pharmacological methods. CONCLUSION: This study preliminarily investigated the pharmacological effects of ZJP, which appear to be mediated by multiple compounds, targets and pathways, and its potential therapeutic effect on pancreatic cancer. Importantly, our work provides a promising approach for the identification of compounds in TCM and the characterization of therapeutic mechanisms.

24709313|t|Metabolomic analysis of biochemical changes in the plasma and urine of collagen-induced arthritis in rats after treatment with Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang.
24709313|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT oren-gedoku-to in Japanese), a classical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, is well known for the treatment of inflammatory-related diseases such as gastritis, dermatitis, and ulcerative colitis. Our previous studies have indicated that HLJDT has therapeutic potential in rheumatoid arthritis treatment. To investigate the therapeutic mechanism of a traditional Chinese medicine formula Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT oren-gedoku-to in Japanese) and its constituents combination for collagen-induced arthritis in rats using a metabolomics approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into 9 groups, and drugs were administered from on the day after the onset of arthritis (day 12) until day 31 of the experiment once daily continuously. Urine and plasma were analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS). Partial least-squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) models were built to evaluate the therapeutic effects of HLJDT and its constituents combination. 15 identified CIA biomarkers were investigated to explain its therapeutic mechanism. RESULTS: Administration of HLJDT and its constituents combination in CIA rats not only significantly reduced arthritic scores and serum levels of IL-1beta but also improved histopathologic changes in joint architecture. Urinary and plasma metabolic profiling revealed that perturbation of energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, oxidative injury and some amino acids metabolism occurred in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Our results also indicated that the disturbed urinary levels of succinic acid, citric acid, creatine, uridine, pantothenic acid, carnitine, phenylacetylglycine, allantoin and plasma levels of phenylpyruvic acid in model rats were gradually restored to normal after administration of HLJDT. The treatment of constituents combination of HLJDT group was able to restore to normal the disturbed urinary levels of citric acid, creatine, pantothenic acid, carnitine, pantothenic acid, phenylacetylglycine and plasma levels of uric acid, L-histidine, and l-phenylalanine in model rats. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that HLJDT and its constituents combination treatment can ameliorate CIA through partially regulating the perturbed energy metabolism. Our work demonstrated that metabonomics-based approach is a promising new tool to evaluate the therapeutic effects and mechanism of complex TCM prescriptions.

35432566|t|Efficacy and Safety of Zuojin Pill for the Treatment of Chronic Nonatrophic Gastritis: A Randomized Active-Controlled Clinical Trial.
35432566|a|Objective: Zuojin pill (ZJP) is used as the classical prescription for a wide variety of digestive diseases. However, there is a lack of direct evidence for its use in the treatment of chronic nonatrophic gastritis (CNG). In particular, there is a lack of rigorous trials of randomized controlled designs. In this study, a randomized active-controlled clinical trial was performed to verify the efficacy and safety of ZJP in detail. Methods: Patients with CNG were divided into the ZJP group and the Marzulene-S granule group. Patients were enrolled from September 2019 to February 2021 (ChiCTR2000040549). Endoscopy and histology scores were evaluated as the primary outcome measure. The Helicobacter pylori positive rate and the disappearance rate of symptoms were also measured to reflect the outcomes. Finally, adverse events were also calculated as the index of safety. Results: A total of 68 eligible patients were enrolled in this trial and randomly divided into two groups with baseline comparability. ZJP was able to improve the red plaques as well as bile reflux scores compared with Marzulene-S granule (P=0.043 and P=0.019, respectively). Moreover, it also remarkably alleviated the active chronic inflammation score (P=0.043). However, there was no difference between the Helicobacter pylori positivity rate (P=0.752). The symptom scores of abdominal distension (P=0.004), belching (P=0.010), and loss of appetite (P=0.019) were alleviated by ZJP, but nausea and vomiting were not (P=0.616). ZJP can also be considered safe with no obvious adverse effects. Conclusion: ZJP might decrease mucosal injury and alleviate symptoms in CNG. In addition, more large-scale clinical trials should be carried out to further confirm its clinical efficacy and safety.

32176067|t|Efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine Long Dan Xie Gan Tang in insomnia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
32176067|a|BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a global public problem, which has a significant negative impact on both physical and mental health, while increasing the economic burden placed on both sufferers and society. Western medicine has a fast treatment on sleep, but it leads to side effects and strong dependence. Long Dan Xie Gan Tang(LDXGT) is a representative Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of insomnia especially which has a bad-tempered symptom, and its effectiveness and safety has been validated clinically. However, there is yet to be any evidence-based medicine. Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of LDXGT in the treatment of insomnia are studied and systematically evaluated in this study. It will provide a theoretical support for the treatment of insomnia compared to western medicine. OBJECTIVE: The study is purposed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of LDXGT for the treatment of insomnia. METHODS: Search was conducted for various databases including Pubmed, Chinese Biomedicine Database(CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), and Wan-fang. Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) were identified for insomnia treatment involving LDXGT and LDXGT combined with ordinary Western medicine. The quality of literature was evaluated by Cochrane assessing tool to reduce the risk of bias. RevMan 5.3 software and STATA 12.0 software were applied to perform the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 1181 participants were identified in this systematic review. Few studies described the details of random principle. No placebo was involved in treatment. LDXGT was compared with ordinary Western medicine in 11 trials and with LDXGT combined with conventional Western medicine in 2 trials. The results of our meta-analysis showed the relative benefits in effective rates compared with conventional western medicine. (Odds Ratio [OR]= 4.32, I = 0%,95% confidence interval CI [3.05 to 6.13], P < .00001) and recovery rate was (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.67, I = 0%,95% confidence interval CI [2.04 to 3.48], P < .00001). In two trials, adverse events were reported, but no serious adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION: Our systematic evaluation will provide evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of LDXGT in the treatment of insomnia, and the side effects of western medicine are addressed. Further trials are necessary to collect the evidence for the use of LDXGT.

10319284|t|Protection of immunosuppressed mice from lethal Candida infection by oral administration of a kampo medicine, hochu-ekki-to.
10319284|a|The protective effect of a Kampo medicine, Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41) on experimental candidiasis in immunosuppressed mice was investigated. ICR mice were immunosuppressed by injection of prednisolone or cyclophosphamide, given TJ-41 orally and challenged intravenously with Candida albicans (day 0). Treatments with a daily dose of 1 g/kg/day of TJ-41 for 8 days from day-4 or for 4 days from day 0 significantly prolonged the life span of the Candida-infected mice pretreated with prednisolone. The latter treatment appeared to inhibit the colonization of Candida in kidneys of the infected mice. These results suggest that Hochu-ekki-to can be used as a therapeutic agent against candidiasis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression.

24744811|t|Effect of huanglian jiedu decoction on thoracic aorta gene expression in spontaneous hypertensive rats.
24744811|a|Objective. Hypertension is one of the most common cardiovascular disorders with high mortality. Here we explored the antihypertension effects of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HJD) on thoracic aorta gene expression in spontaneous hypertensive rats. Methods. A rat model of spontaneous hypertension was used. The gene change profile of thoracic aorta after JHD treatment was assessed by GeneChip(GC) analysis using the Agilent Whole Rat Genome Oligo Microarray. Results. Hypertension induced 441 genes upregulated and 417 genes downregulated compared with the normal control group. Treatment of HJD resulted in 76 genes downregulated and 20 genes upregulated. GC data analysis showed that the majority of change genes were involved in immune system process, developmental process, and cell death. Conclusion. Hypertension altered expression of many genes that regulate various biological functions. HJD significantly reduced hypertension and altered the gene expression profiles of SHR rats. These changing genes were involved in many cellular functions such as regulating smooth muscle contraction, Ca(2+) homeostasis, and NO pathway. This study provides the potential novel insights into hypertension and antihypertension effects of HJD.

11379041|t|Dichotomous effect of a traditional Japanese medicine, bu-zhong-yi-qi-tang on allergic asthma in mice.
11379041|a|To determine the potentiality of prophylactic and/or therapeutic approaches using a traditional herbal medicine, Bu-zhong-yi-qi-tang (Japanese name: Hochu-ekki-to, HOT), for the control of allergic disease, we examined the effects of oral administration of HOT on a murine model of asthma allergic responses. When oral administration of HOT was begun at the induction phase immediately after OVA sensitization, eosinophilia and Th2-type cytokine production in the airway were reduced in OVA-sensitized mice following OVA inhalation. The serum levels of OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E and IgG1 were significantly decreased, whereas the level of OVA-specific IgG2a was increased. Interleukin (IL)-4 production by spleen T cells in response to OVA was significantly suppressed, while Interferon (IFN)-gamma production was increased in mice treated with HOT in the induction phase. On the other hand, HOT given in the eliciting phase induced a predominant Th2 response with increased IgE production in OVA-sensitized mice following OVA inhalation. These results suggest that the oral administration of HOT dichotomously modulates allergic inflammation in a murine model for asthma, thus offering a different approach for the treatment of allergic disorders.

26596842|t|Metabolomic study on the faecal extracts of atherosclerosis mice and its application in a Traditional Chinese Medicine.
26596842|a|The intestinal microbiota and their metabolites are closely related to the formation of atherosclerosis (AS). In this study, a metabolomic approach based on the reversed-phase liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS) platform was established to analyze the metabolic profiling of fecal extracts from AS mice model. The established metabolomic platform was also used for clearing the effective mechanism of a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) named Sishen granule (SSKL). Totally, sixteen potential biomarkers in faeces of AS mice were identified and 5 of them could be reversed by SSKL. Through functional analysis of these biomarkers and the established network, lipid metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, energy cycle, and inflammation reaction were considered as the most relevant pathological changes in gastrointestinal tract of AS mice. The metabolomic study not only revealed the potential biomarkers in AS mice' faeces but also supplied a systematic view of the pathological changes in gastrointestinal metabolite in AS mice. This metabolomic study also demonstrated that SSKL had the therapeutic effectiveness on AS through partly reversing the lipid metabolism, inflammation and energy metabolism.

22493681|t|Metabonomic profiles delineate the effect of traditional Chinese medicine sini decoction on myocardial infarction in rats.
22493681|a|BACKGROUND: In spite of great advances in target-oriented Western medicine for treating myocardial infarction (MI), it is still a leading cause of death in a worldwide epidemic. In contrast to Western medicine, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) uses a holistic and synergistic approach to restore the balance of Yin-Yang of body energy so the body's normal function can be restored. Sini decoction (SND) is a well-known formula of TCM which has been used to treat MI for many years. However, its holistic activity evaluation and mechanistic understanding are still lacking due to its complex components. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A urinary metabonomic method based on nuclear magnetic resonance and ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was developed to characterize MI-related metabolic profiles and delineate the effect of SND on MI. With Elastic Net for classification and selection of biomarkers, nineteen potential biomarkers in rat urine were screened out, primarily related to myocardial energy metabolism, including the glycolysis, citrate cycle, amino acid metabolism, purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism. With the altered metabolism pathways as possible drug targets, we systematically analyze the therapeutic effect of SND, which demonstrated that SND administration could provide satisfactory effect on MI through partially regulating the perturbed myocardial energy metabolism. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results showed that metabonomic approach offers a useful tool to identify MI-related biomarkers and provides a new methodological cue for systematically dissecting the underlying efficacies and mechanisms of TCM in treating MI.

28852318|t|Efficacy and safety of Xiangsha Liujunzi granules for functional dyspepsia: A multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study.
28852318|a|AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of a Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), Xiangsha Liujunzi granules, in the treatment of patients with functional dyspepsia (FD). METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with patients from three centers. Two hundred and sixteen subjects diagnosed with FD according to ROME III criteria and confirmed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and spleen-deficiency and Qi-stagnation syndrome were selected to receive Xiangsha Liujunzi granules or placebo for 4 wk in a 2:1 ratio by blocked randomization. The subjects also received follow-up after the 4-wk intervention. Herbal or placebo granules were dissolved in 300 mL of water. Participants in both groups were administered 130 mL (45 degrees C) three times a day. Participants were evaluated prior to and following 4 wk of the intervention in terms of changes in the postprandial discomfort severity scale (PDSS) score, clinical global impression (CGI) scale score, hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) score, traditional Chinese medicine symptoms score (SS), scores of various domains of the 36-item short form health survey (SF-36), gastric emptying (GE) and any observed adverse effects. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, patients in the CHM group showed significant improvements in the scores of PDSS, HADS, SS, SF-36 and CGI scale (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). They also showed the amelioration in the GE rates of the proximal stomach and distal stomach (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Xiangsha Liujunzi granules offered significant symptomatic improvement in patients with FD.

33152436|t|Hepatoprotective effects of Huangqi decoction (Astragali Radix and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) on cholestatic liver injury in mice: Involvement of alleviating intestinal microbiota dysbiosis.
33152436|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gut microbiome dysbiosis is closely associated with cholestatic liver disease. Huangqi decoction (HQD), a traditional herbal formula, has protection against cholestatic liver injury. However, the effect of HQD on gut microbiome remains unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effect of HQD on 3, 5-diethoxycarbonyl-1, 4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) induced cholestatic liver injury and its effect on the gut microbiome profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice with DDC-induced cholestatic liver injury were treated with low and high doses of HQD for 8 weeks. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16 S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Barrier function as well as intestinal and hepatic inflammation was analyzed by real-time PCR and western blotting. RESULTS: HQD treatment ameliorated the DDC-induced liver injury and collagen deposition around hepatic bile ducts. Moreover, decreased diversity, reduced richness, and abnormal composition of intestinal microbiota of cholestatic mice were remarkably attenuated by HQD supplementation. Differences in bacterial abundance, including levels of Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Alistipes, and Gordonibacter, were increased in DDC-induced mice, as compared with control mice, and were decreased after HQD treatment. Moreover, intestinal dysbiosis promoted disruption of the intestinal barrier in cholestatic mice. However, HQD treatment alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction. Importantly, increased hepatic expression of pro-inflammatory factors and the NLRP3 inflammasome, which have a positive correlation with differential bacteria, were characteristics found in DDC-induced cholestatic mice that were alleviated upon treatment with HQD. CONCLUSION: HQD treatment alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis, ameliorated the intestinal barrier dysfunction, inhibited liver inflammation, and protected against DDC-induced cholestatic liver injury.

24653580|t|p38 MAPK signal pathway involved in anti-inflammatory effect of Chaihu-Shugan-San and Shen-ling-bai-zhu-San on hepatocyte in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis rats.
24653580|a|BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has over thousands-of-years history of use. Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS), and Shen-ling-bai-zhu-San (SLBZS), are famous traditional Chinese herbal medicine formulas, which have been used in China, for the treatment of many chronic diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of CSS and SLBZS on signaling molecules involved in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), pathway on hepatocytes of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), rats induced by high fat diet. SD male rats were randomly divided into 8 groups: negative control group, model control group, high (9.6g/kg/day)/low (3.2g/kg/day)-dose CSS group, high (30g/kg/day)/low (10g/kg/day)-dose SLBZS group, high (39.6g/kg/day)/low (13.2g/kg/day)-dose integrated group. The rats of NASH model were induced by feeding a high-fat diet. After 16, wks, Hepatocytes were isolated from 6, rats in each group by collagenase perfusion. The liver histopathological changes and serum inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 were determined. The proteins of TLR4, phosphor-p38 MAPK and p38 MAPK involved in p38 MAPK signal pathway were assayed. RESULTS: The statistical data indicated the NASH model rats reproduced typical histopathological features of NASH in human. CSS and SLBZS ameliorated lipid metabolic disturbance, attenuated NASH progression, decreased the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in serum, as well as inhibited TLR4 protein expression, p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and activation of p38 MAPK. In conclusion, CSS and SLBZS might work as a significant anti-inflammatory effect on hepatocyte of NASH by inhibiting the activation of TLR4, p-p38 MAPK and p38 MAPK involved in p38 MAPK signal pathway. CONCLUSION: To some extent, CSS and SLBZS may be a potential alternative and complementary medicine to protect against liver injury, alleviate the inflammation reaction, moderate NASH progression.

31819371|t|A Network Pharmacology-Based Strategy For Predicting Active Ingredients And Potential Targets Of LiuWei DiHuang Pill In Treating Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
31819371|a|BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations have proven to be advantageous in clinical treatment and prevention of disease. LiuWei DiHuang Pill (LWDH Pill) is a TCM that was employed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, a holistic network pharmacology approach to understanding the active ingredients and the therapeutic mechanisms underlying T2DM has not been pursued. METHODS: A network pharmacology approach including drug-likeness evaluation, oral bioavailability prediction, virtual docking, and network analysis has been used to predict the active ingredients and potential targets of LWDH Pill in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: The comprehensive network pharmacology approach was successfully to identify 45 active ingredients in LWDH Pill. 45 active ingredients hit by 163 potential targets related to T2DM. Ten of the more highly predictive components (such as :quercetin, Kaempferol, Stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, Kadsurenone, Diosgenin, hancinone C, Hederagenin, Garcinone B, Isofucosterol) are involved in anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, and the reduction of beta cell damage. LWDH Pill may play a role in the treatment of T2DM and its complications (atherosclerosis and nephropathy) through the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Based on a systematic network pharmacology approach, our works successfully predict the active ingredients and potential targets of LWDH Pill for application to T2DM and helps to illustrate mechanism of action on a comprehensive level. This study provides identify key genes and pathway associated with the prognosis and pathogenesis of T2DM from new insights, which also demonstrates a feasible method for the research of chemical basis and pharmacology in LWDH Pill.

15879682|t|Shengmai San, a Chinese herbal medicine protects against rat heat stroke by reducing inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide formation.
15879682|a|The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether the possible occurrence of overproduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-dependent nitric oxide (NO) in the brain and inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood exhibited during heat stroke can be reduced by prior administration of Shengmai San, a Chinese herbal medicine. Aminoguanidine, an iNOS inhibitor, was evaluated at the same time as a reference (positive control). Urethane-anesthetized rats were exposed to heat stress (ambient temperature of 43 degrees C) to induce heat stroke. Control rats were exposed to 24 degrees C. Mean arterial pressure and cerebral blood flow after the onset of heat stroke were all significantly lower than in control rats. However, cerebral iNOS immunoreactivity and NO levels were all greater after the onset of heat stroke. The serum levels of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were all increased after the onset of heat stroke. Shengmai San (1.2 g/ml per rat) or aminoguanidine (30 micromol/ml per rat) was administered orally, daily, and consecutively for 7 days before the initiation of heat stress; and this significantly attenuated the heat stress-induced arterial hypotension, cerebral ischemia, and increased levels of brain iNOS-dependent NO production and serum cytokines formation. Shengmai San shared with the aminoguanidine almost the same efficacy in reducing iNOS-dependent NO and cytokines overproduction during heat stroke. These results suggest that Shengmai San or aminoguanidine protects against heat stroke-induced arterial hypotension and cerebral ischemia by inhibition of iNOS-dependent NO overproduction in the brain and excessive accumulation of several inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood stream.

32963569|t|Mechanisms and Molecular Targets of the Tao-Hong-Si-Wu-Tang Formula for Treatment of Osteonecrosis of Femoral Head: A Network Pharmacology Study.
32963569|a|The Tao-Hong-Si-Wu-Tang (THSWT) formula, a classic prescription of traditional Chinese medicine, has long been used for the treatment of osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONFH). However, its mechanisms of action and molecular targets are not comprehensively clear. In the present study, the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology (TCMSP) database was employed to retrieve the active compounds of each herb included in the THSWT formula. After identifying the drug targets of active compounds and disease targets of ONFH, intersection analysis was conducted to screen out the shared targets. The protein-protein network of the shared targets was built for further topological analysis. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were then carried out. A gene pathway network was constructed to screen the core target genes. We identified 61 active compounds, 155 drug targets, and 5443 disease targets. However, intersection analysis only screened out 37 shared targets. Kaempferol, luteolin, and baicalein regulated the greatest number of targets associated with ONFH. The THSWT formula may regulate osteocyte function through specific biological processes, including responses to toxic substances and oxidative stress. The regulated pathways included the relaxin, focal adhesion, nuclear factor-kappaB, toll-like receptor, and AGE/RAGE signaling pathways. RELA, VEGFA, and STAT1 were the important target genes in the gene network associated with the THSWT formula for the treatment of ONFH. Therefore, the present study suggested that the THSWT formula has an action mechanism involving multiple compounds and network targets for the treatment of ONFH.

19431987|t|[Research of You Gui Yin and MSCs interventional therapy on early avascular necrosis of the femoral head].
19431987|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of You Gui Yin and MSCs interventional therapy on the early stage of avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) and its role of improving revascularization and reossification. METHODS: Twenty-four adult Beagle dogs weighing (10.0 +/- 0.5) kg were divided into 4 groups (n=6): group A (model group), group B (You Gui Yin group), group C (MSCs intervention group), group D(You Gui Yin and MSCs intervention group). The model of ANFH at early stage was established by liquid-nitrogen cryopreservation method, and MSCs were isolated, cultured and labeled by BrdU. Three weeks after modeling, groups C and D received 1 mL MSCs with artery perfusion [(0.5-1.0) x 10(6)/mL)], groups B and D received intragastric administration of 100 mL You Gui Yin per day, groups A and C received intragastric administration of 100 mL distilled water. Gross observation on femoral head was conducted 4 and 8 weeks after continuous treatment. Meanwhile, DSA and MRI were adopted to observe the quantity and the diameter of femoral head blood vessel, histology and immunohistochemistry staining were performed to observe the expression of VEGF and BrdU, and the expression of VEGF mRNA was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: At 4 and 8 weeks after treatment, the figuration of the femoral head in group A was flat and mushroom-shaped, while it was relatively normal in groups B, C and D. DSA observation: the number and the diameter of blood vessel in groups C and D were increased, and the obstructed blood vessel was open. At 4 and 8 weeks after treatment, significant differences between group C and group D were evident in the number and the diameter of blood vessel (P < 0.05); compared with before treatment, the diameter of blood vessel in two groups were significantly improved (P < 0.05) and the number of blood vessel in group D was significantly increased (P < 0.05). MRI observation: compared with group A, groups B, C and D were obviously improved, especially group D, T1W showed lower signal, T2W and STIR showed no abnormal changes of signal. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry staining: compared with group A, the structure of groups B, C and D were obviously improved, the positive expression of VEGF in group D was significantly higher than that of other groups (P < 0.05), the positive rate of BrdU, the number of positive osteoblast and the number of positive blood vessel in group D was obviously higher than that of group C (P < 0.05). Real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR detection: the expression of VEGF mRNA in group D was significantly higher than that of other groups (P < 0.05), the expression of VEGF in groups B, C and D was higher than that of group A (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of You Gui Yin and MSCs interventional treatment has significant therapeutic effects on the early-stage ANFH, can improve the blood supply of the necrotic femoral head, promote repair and prevent collapse.

24082327|t|Effect of tao-hong-si-wu-tang, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine formula, on physical fatigue in mice.
24082327|a|Tao-Hong-Si-Wu-Tang (THSWT) is a famous traditional Chinese herbal medicine formula, which has traditionally been used in China for about one thousand years. The present study investigated the effect of THSWT on physical fatigue. 32 male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups with 8 in each group. All were administered orally and daily for 28 days. Group I received isotonic saline solution as control; Group II, III and IV obtained 5, 10 and 20ml/ kg body weight of THSWT solutions, respectively. After 28 days, the anti-physical fatigue effect of THSWT was evaluated by using a forced swimming test, along with the determination of blood lactic acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), liver glycogen and muscle glycogen contents. The data showed that THSWT could extend exhaustive swimming time of mice, as well as decrease the BLA and BUN contents and increase the liver glycogen and muscle glycogen contents. The results support that THSWT had anti-physical fatigue effect.

23861702|t|The Effects of Banha-sasim-tang on Dyspeptic Symptoms and Gastric Motility in Cases of Functional Dyspepsia: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, and Two-Center Trial.
23861702|a|Introduction. Functional dyspepsia (FD) is highly prevalent, and no standard treatments exist for this condition. Herbal prescriptions are widely used to treat FD. In traditional Korean medicine, Banha-sasim-tang (BST) is a famous herbal prescription for dyspepsia. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of BST and to examine the relationship between gastric slow waves and dyspeptic symptoms. Materials and Methods. In total, 100 FD patients were recruited; BST or placebo was administered for 6 weeks. The gastrointestinal symptom scale, FD-related quality of life scale, and frequency or power variables regarding gastric slow waves were measured at 0, 6, and 14 weeks. Results. There were no significant differences in the overall dyspeptic symptoms or quality of life between the BST and placebo groups. However, early satiety was significantly improved in the BST group (P = 0.009, at 6 weeks by intention-to-treat analysis). Abnormal gastric dysrhythmias and power ratios were also significantly improved by BST. Conclusion. BST had no significant effects on FD. However, early satiety appeared to improve after BST administration. Electrogastrography may be a useful technique for assessing changes in gastric motility dysfunction after interventions for FD. Further investigation focused on specific symptoms or subtypes of FD is required.

3292675|t|Effect of a traditional herbal medicine (shakuyaku-kanzo-to) on testosterone secretion in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome detected by ultrasound.
3292675|a|In 20 infertile Japanese with polycystic ovary syndrome Shakuyaku-Kanzo-To was used to lower plasma testosterone levels and hence to induce pregnancy. The polycystic ovary was classified into two types; general cystic and peripheral cystic patterns. Plasma testosterone was decreased in 18/20 (90%) and 5/20 (25%) became pregnant. The plasma testosterone concentration in the case of the general cystic pattern was significantly higher than that of peripheral cystic pattern, and the pregnancy rate in those with the general cystic pattern was lower. The efficacy of Shakuyaku-Kanzo-To therefore seems to vary according to the type of polycystic ovary syndrome treated.

31678637|t|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du extract ameliorates atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions induced by 2,4-dinitrobenzene in mice via suppression of MAPKs and NF-kappaB pathways.
31678637|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huang-Lian-Jie-Du Decoction (HLJDD), is a well-known traditional Chinese herbal formula first written in the Tang dynasty. In Chinese medicine practice, HLJDD is commonly prescribed to treat various inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed at investigating the therapeutic effect of HLJDD extract (HLJDE) and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of action in the 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD-like mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female Balb/c mice were sensitized with DNCB for three days. After sensitization, mice were challenged with DNCB every three days and orally administrated with HLJDE (150, 300 and 600mg/kg) daily from day 14 to day 29 for consecutive 16 days. At the end of experiment, the clinical AD scores of the mice were calculated to evaluate the therapeutic effect of HLJDE, and serum, ears and dorsal skin of the mice were collected for unravelling molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: HLJDE significantly reduced the clinical symptoms in the AD-like mice by inhibiting eosinophil and mast cell infiltration, suppressing the production of Th2-associated cytokine (IL-4) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha). In addition, HLJDE significantly suppressed the NF-kappaB and MAPKs pathways. Moreover, HLJDE was able to accentuate filaggrin expression in the skin lesion when compared to the sensitized mouse without treatment. CONCLUSION: HLJDE significantly improved the AD-like symptoms on the DNCB-sensitized mice through mitigating the production of inflammatory mediators via suppressing MAPKs and NF-kappaB pathways. Additionally, the elevated expression of filaggrin in the skin lesion by HLJDE contributes to the recovery of dysfunctional skin barrier on the DNCB-sensitized mice.
31678637|k|CONCLUSION: HLJDE significantly improved the AD-like symptoms on the DNCB-sensitized mice through mitigating the production of inflammatory mediators via suppressing MAPKs and NF-kappaB pathways.

32148544|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiarthritic effects of different polar solvent extracts of Er Miao San (EMS) on model rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA) and screen the effective pats of EMS in the treatment of arthritis. METHODS: Four different polar solvent extracts of EMS such as petroleum ether (PE), methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and n-butanol (n-butanol (. RESULTS: Administration of EtOAc and CH2Cl2 parts remarkably inhibited the paw swelling, decreased the index of arthritis, decreased the body weight loss, and improved the changes of histopathology. Furthermore, the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) were significantly lower, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) was remarkably higher compared with that in the model group. And the result of UHPLC analysis indicated that the effective parts of EMS contain berberine and atractylodin. CONCLUSIONS: EtOAc and CH2Cl2 are the effective parts of EMS that can improve arthritis. In particular, berberine and atractylodin may be responsible for the antiarthritic activity of EMS. This research provided pharmacological and chemical foundation for the application of EMS in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

24574726|t|Xiangshaliujunzi Decoction for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis: a systematic review.
24574726|a|AIM: To assess the current clinical evidence of the effectiveness of Xiangshaliujunzi Decoction (XSLJZD) for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis (DGP). METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved from seven major electronic databases including Medline, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and Wanfang Databases, using search dates from the beginning of the databases to May 2013. No language limitations were applied. We included RCTs that used XSLJZD or a modified XSLJZD compared with a control group for the treatment of DGP. The control groups included conventional treatment (Western medicinal treatment), placebo, and no treatment (blank), but not acupuncture. The main outcome index was clinical effectiveness, which was based on the gastric emptying test and variations in the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms between the treatment and control groups after intervention. Data extraction, analysis, and quality assessment were conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions, Version 5.1.0. RESULTS: Ten RCTs involving 867 patients (441 in the experimental groups, and 426 in the control groups) were identified, and the overall methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. In the treatment groups, all 10 trials used herbs alone as the treatment, whereas all control groups used prokinetic medicine. The period of intervention ranged from 2 to 8 wk. Three classes were used to evaluate treatment efficacy: significant effective, effective, and ineffective, and all trials used the clinical effective rate (based on the gastric emptying test and changes in GI symptoms) to evaluate efficacy. The data showed that the effects of XSLJZD for the treatment of DGP were superior to the control group (n = 867, RR =1.33, 95%CI: 1.24-1.42, Z = 8.11, P < 0.00001). Two trials recorded adverse events, and one trial reported follow-up. CONCLUSION: XSLJZD could restore the gastric emptying rate and improve symptoms. However, the evidence remains weak due to the poor methodological quality of the included studies.

1816724|t|Effect of sho-saiko-to(xiao-chai-hu-tang) on HBeAg clearance in children with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and with sustained liver disease.
1816724|a|We studied the effect of Sho-saiko-to (Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang) on HBeAg clearance rate (SN rate) in fourteen children with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and with sustained liver disease. Seven of fourteen patients (50.0%) became HBeAg negative in the average observation period of 0.47 years(0.2-0.9 years). Four of those seven patients developed anti-HBe. The annual SN rate in the She-saiko-to treated group was apparently higher than the natural annual SN rate (22.7%) of 22 untreated patients retrospectively reviewed from the onset of hepatitis. Sho-saiko-to seemed to promote clearance of HBeAg in children with chronic HBV infection and with sustained liver disease. Sho-saiko-to may be a useful drug for such patients.

32744029|t|Efficacy of Shenfu decoction on sepsis in rats with condition induced by cecal ligation and puncture.
32744029|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Shenfu decoction (SFD) prepared with a traditional Chinese formula, on sepsis in rats with the condition induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and to study the possible mechanism underlying its action. METHODS: Forty clean-grade male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into three groups: normal control group (NCG, n = 10), model control group (MCG, n = 15) and Shenfu decoction group (SFDG, n = 15). Sham-operated rats in NCG were served as operation control, while rats in both MCG and SFDG were exposed to CLP, a procedure to develop experimental sepsis. Rats in SFDG were administered with SFD by gavage (3 mg/g of body weight, twice a day) 2 h prior to CLP and directly after successful CLP, while rats in NCG and MCG were gavaged with equivalent volume of sterilized water. Rats in all groups were starved with free access to drink. After 24 h of administration, the mortality of rats in each group was assessed. The indicators of inflammatory response [the peritoneal inflammation by Simon's method Classification as well as serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] in survival rats were evaluated. The indicators of gut barrier [The intestinal mucosal injury index, serum concentrations of D-lactic acid and secretory IgA (sIgA) in intestinal mucosa by ELISA, as well as gut microbiota by16S rRNA gene sequencing] in survival rats were evaluated. RESULTS: The mortality (20%) of rats in SFDG was lower than that (33.3%) of the MCG (P < 0.01). The mortality (20%) of rats in SFDG was lower than that (33.3%) of the MCG (chi2 = 6.533, P = 0.011). Compared with the MCG,the peritoneal inflammation as well as serum concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6 decreased significantly in SFDG (all P < 0.01). Compared with the MCG, the IMII, serum concentrations of D-lactic acid, sIgA in intestinal mucosa were alleviated by SFD treatment (all P < 0.01). Increase in levels of Proteobacteria and reduction levels of Bacteroidetes induced by sepsis were observed, and these two disturbed gut microbiota phyla could be regulated after SFD treatment. Increase in levels of Proteobacteria and reduction levels of Bacteroidetes induced by sepsis were observed, and these two disturbed gut microbiota phyla could be regulated after SFD treatment. CONCLUSION: SFD may play a protective role in sepsis by alleviating sepsis-induced inflammatory response and gut barrier damage in rats.

33478536|t|Network pharmacology based research into the effect and mechanism of Yinchenhao Decoction against Cholangiocarcinoma.
33478536|a|BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma refers to an epithelial cell malignancy with poor prognosis. Yinchenhao decoction (YCHD) showed positive effects on cancers, and associations between YCHD and cholangiocarcinoma remain unclear. This study aimed to screen out the effective active components of Yinchenhao decoction (YCHD) using network pharmacology, estimate their potential targets, screen out the pathways, as well as delve into the potential mechanisms on treating cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS: By the traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP) as well as literature review, the major active components and their corresponding targets were estimated and screened out. Using the software Cytoscape 3.6.0, a visual network was established using the active components of YCHD and the targets of cholangiocarcinoma. Based on STRING online database, the protein interaction network of vital targets was built and analyzed. With the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) server, the gene ontology (GO) biological processes and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways of the targets enrichment were performed. The AutoDock Vina was used to perform molecular docking and calculate the binding affinity. The PyMOL software was utilized to visualize the docking results of active compounds and protein targets. In vivo experiment, the IC50 values and apoptosis rate in PI-A cells were detected using CCK-8 kit and Cell Cycle Detection Kit. The predicted targets were verified by the real-time PCR and western blot methods. RESULTS: 32 effective active components with anti-tumor effects of YCHD were sifted in total, covering 209 targets, 96 of which were associated with cancer. Quercetin, kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, isorhamnetin, and stigmasterol were identified as the vital active compounds, and AKT1, IL6, MAPK1, TP53 as well as VEGFA were considered as the major targets. The molecular docking revealed that these active compounds and targets showed good binding interactions. These 96 putative targets exerted therapeutic effects on cancer by regulating signaling pathways (e.g., hepatitis B, the MAPK signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and MicroRNAs in cancer). Our in vivo experimental results confirmed that YCHD showed therapeutic effects on cholangiocarcinoma by decreasing IC50 values, down-regulating apoptosis rate of cholangiocarcinoma cells, and lowering protein expressions. CONCLUSIONS: As predicted by network pharmacology strategy and validated by the experimental results, YCHD exerts anti-tumor effectsthrough multiple components, targets, and pathways, thereby providing novel ideas and clues for the development of preparations and the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.

15684487|t|Oren-gedoku-to and Keishi-bukuryo-gan-ryo inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis in diet-induced hypercholesterolemic rabbits.
15684487|a|In this study, we examined whether the Kampo formulas Oren-gedoku-to (OGT, Huanglian-jie-du-tang in Chinese) and Keishi-bukuryo-gan-ryo (KBG, Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan in Chinese) could prevent the progression of atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbit, an animal model for hypercholesterolemia in vivo. Twenty-four male Japanese white rabbits (2 kg body weight) were divided into four groups. The control group was fed standard rabbit chow containing 1% cholesterol, the OGT group was fed standard rabbit chow containing 1% cholesterol and 1% OGT, the KBG group was fed standard rabbit chow containing 1% cholesterol and 1% KBG, and the vitamin E group was fed standard rabbit chow containing 1% cholesterol and vitamin E (450 mg/1000 g). All four groups were kept on these diets for 8 weeks. At the end of the experiments, the percentage of surface area of the total thoracic aorta with visible plaque was significantly reduced in the OGT and KBG groups. The serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances of the vitamin E group showed a significantly low value compared with the control group, whereas the serum lipid peroxide levels of the OGT and KBG groups were considerably lower than that of the control groups as well as that of the vitamin E group. Furthermore, the urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels of the OGT and KBG groups were considerably lower than that of the vitamin E group. These results suggest that OGT and KBG prevent the progression of atheromatous plaque by creating a sounder antioxidant defense system than vitamin E.

23174583|t|[Effect of Baitouweng Decoction on intestinal miR-19a expression in mice with ulcerative colitis].
23174583|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of Baitouweng Decoction on dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis in mice and explore its mechanism involving miR-19a. METHODS: Forty female c57 mice were randomly allocated into 4 equal groups, namely the normal control group, model group (treated with 3.5% DSS solution), treatment group (treated with DSS+Baitouweng Decoction), and positive control group (treated with DSS+5-ASA). Ulcerative colitis was induced in the mice by feeding them with 3.5% DSS in drinking water, and the mice in the control group were given water only. The disease activity index (DAI) of the mice in each group was recorded daily. Seven days later, the mice were sacrificed for histological examination of the intestines using HE staining; the expression of miR-19a mRNA in the intestines was detected using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the model group showed significantly increased DAI and histological scores, and administration of Baitouweng Decoction significantly lowered the DAI and histological scores of the DSS-treated mice. The expression of miR-19a was lowered following DSS treatment, and Baitouweng Decoction treatment caused an increased miR-19a expression in DSS-treated mice. CONCLUSION: Baitouweng Decoction has therapeutic effects on DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice, and this effect is probably mediated by enhancement of miR-19a expression in the intestines.

17259121|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the anti-tumor effect of Biejiajianwan pills and explore its mechanism. METHODS: Mice bearing neoplasm induced by H22 cell inoculation were randomized into 4 groups, namely the negative control group, positive control group (with cyclophosphamide treatment), and high- and low-dose Biejiajianwan pill group. The tumor-bearing mice received corresponding treatments for 15 consecutive days, after which their thymuses and spleens were isolated and weighed to calculate the thymus and spleen indices. The tumor mass was also weighed and the tumor inhibition rate calculated. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression intensity of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the tumor tissue. RESULTS: The pills significantly inhibited the growth of the implanted tumor and reduced the expression of PCNA in the tumor. CONCLUSION: One of the possible mechanisms of the anti-tumor effects of Biejiajian pills might be associated with the inhibition of PCNA expression in the tumor.

21495102|t|A Chinese herbal decoction, Danggui Buxue Tang, improves chronic fatigue syndrome induced by food restriction and forced swimming in rats.
21495102|a|Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT), a Chinese medicinal decoction that contains Radix Angelicae sinensis (Danggui) and Radix Astragali (Huangqi) at a ratio of 1:5, is used commonly for treating women's ailments. The present study explored the effects of this preparation on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Rats were subjected to a combination of food restriction and forced swimming to induce CFS, and rats were gavaged once daily with either 12 or 24 g/kg DBT for 28 days. Body weights, T-cell subset counts, (3) H-TdR incorporation measurements and mRNA levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, NF-small ka, CyrillicB, p38MAPK and JNK were determined on days 14 and 28. The swimming endurance capacity was measured on day 28. Rats that received DBT exhibited increased body weight and endurance capacity, corrected T cell subsets counts, increased (3) H-TdR incorporation and decreased mRNA levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, NF-small ka, CyrillicB, p38MAPK and JNK compared with rats that did not receive DBT. The results indicate that DBT can ameliorate CFS through immune modulation and may act to normalize cytokines and their related signaling pathways.

31220598|t|Xiexin Tang ameliorates dyslipidemia in high-fat diet-induced obese rats via elevating gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids production and adjusting energy metabolism.
31220598|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional herbal medicine has been taken as a new and effective approach to treat many chronic diseases. Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut microbiota, especially for some short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of obesity is not yet clear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of obesity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of energy metabolism were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis. RESULTS: Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid metabolism disorders, alleviate systematic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut microbiota-derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of SCFA-synthetic key enzymes such as acetate kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the energy charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha)/uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing weight from energy metabolism regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation. The study provided useful information for XXT in clinical application to treat obesity.

35391788|t|Involvement of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction on Microglia with Abnormal Sphingolipid Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease.
35391788|a|Background: Abnormal sphingolipid metabolism is closely related to the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With heat-clearing and detoxifying effects, Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD) has been used to treat dementia and improve learning and memory impairments. Purpose: To study the therapeutic effect of HLJDD on AD as it relates to sphingolipid metabolism. Methods: The level of sphingolipids in the brains of APP/PS1 mice and in the supernatant of beta-amyloid (Abeta)25-35-induced BV2 microglia was detected by HPLC-QTOF-MS and HPLC-QTRAP-MS techniques, respectively. The co-expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) and Abeta as well as four enzymes related to sphingolipid metabolism, including serine palmitoyltransferase 2 (SPTLC2), cer synthase 2 (CERS2), sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1), and sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SGMS1), in the brains of APP/PS1 mice were evaluated by immunofluorescence double labelling. In addition, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was conducted to determine the mRNA expression of SPTLC2, CERS2, SMPD1, SGMS1, galactosylceramidase (GALC), and sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2) in Abeta25-35-stimulated BV2 microglia. Results: Abnormal sphingolipid metabolism was observed both in APP/PS1 mouse brain tissues and Abeta25-35-stimulated BV2 cells. The levels of sphingosine, sphinganine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, sphinganine-1-phosphate and sphingomyelin were significantly reduced, while the levels of ceramide-1-phosphate, ceramide, lactosylceramide and hexosylceramide significantly increased in Abeta25-35-stimulated BV2 cells. In AD mice, more microglia were clustered in the Abeta-positive region. The decreased level of SGMS1 and increased levels of CERS2, SPTLC and SMPD1 were also found. In addition, the expressions of SPTLC2, CERS2, and SMPD1 in Abeta25-35-stimulated BV2 cells were increased significantly, while the expressions of GALC, SPHK2, and SGMS1 were decreased. These changes all showed a significant correction after HLJDD treatment. Conclusion: HLJDD is a good candidate for treating AD. This study provides a novel perspective on the potential roles of the sphingolipid metabolism in AD.

31682377|t|Differential gene expression profile of Buyanghuanwu decoction in rats with ventricular remodeling post-myocardial infarction.
31682377|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Buyanghuanwu decoction (BYHWD) on gene expression in ventricular remodeling post-myocardial infarction in rats. METHODS: Animal models of myocardial infarction were established by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Echocardiography measurements were performed after the treatment of BYHWD (18 gkg-1d-1) for 90 days. Myocardial collagen was observed by mallory trichrome staining. Capillary density was quantified by using Factor VIII immunohistochemical staining. Differentially expressed genes were explored by a short-read sequencing technology combined with a tag-based digital gene expression profiling (DGE) system. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction detecting system (qPCR) was used to validate the sequencing results. After assembling the gene information from Sham, model and BYHWD groups, we constructed three DGE libraries based on each group. The sequencing of three libraries generated 66 000-73 000 unique tags, which were mapped to reference sequences for annotation of expressed genes. RESULTS: Among them, 511 and 352 differentially expressed genes were found in comparison with sham/model and model/BYHWD, respectively. Fifty-five genes exhibited reversed direction of gene expression differences between Sham/Model and Model/BYHWD groups. We found that transforming growth factor beta receptor-1, junctophilin-2, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, neuropeptide Y, arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase, arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase were significantly modulated, which suggested the involvement of these genes in BYHWD treatment. CONCLUSION: The DGE profiling data provide comprehensive gene expression information at the transcriptional level that could facilitate our understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of BYHWD in ventricular remodeling post-myocardial infarction.

26612995|t|Antioxidant Formulae, Shengmai San, and LingGuiZhuGanTang, Prevent MPTP Induced Brain Dysfunction and Oxidative Damage in Mice.
26612995|a|The present study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of antioxidative traditional oriental medicine formulae, Shengmai San (SMS) and LingGuiZhuGanTang (LGZGT), against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (i.p 30 mg.kg(-1) for 5 consecutive days) induced neurotoxicity. In in vitro antioxidant assays measured with Trolox and butyl hydroxyl toluene as reference antioxidant revealed that SMS has higher scavenging potential against hydroxyl radical than superoxide anion radical, but LGZGT was the reverse. The neuroprotective effect of SMS and LGZGT against MPTP was evaluated in mice by behavioral, biochemical, and immunohistochemical studies. In the behavioral study, both SMS and LGZGT significantly reversed the locomotive impairment induced by MPTP. Simultaneously, both formulae significantly prevented the MPTP induced dopaminergic neuron loss assessed by tyrosine hydroxylase in the midbrain. Both SMS and LGZGT significantly attenuated the elevated lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls levels by MPTP. The DNA damage induced by MPTP was also prevented by both formulae. Although a little difference in the protective functions was observed between the two formulae, such as in DNA damage and behavioral studies, the results indicate that both SMS and LGZGT with antioxidant property act as a good candidate applicable for the antioxidant based complementary therapies of neurodegenerative diseases.

25637158|t|Classic herbal formula Zhigancao Decoction for the treatment of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs): a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
25637158|a|BACKGROUND: To systematically assess the current clinical evidence of Zhigancao (ZGC) Decoction for premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, the Cochrane Center Controlled Trials Register, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, and Wanfang Med Online Database were searched until June 2014. We included randomized clinical trials testing ZGC Decoction against anti-arrhythmic drugs, ZGC Decoction combined with anti-arrhythmic drugs versus anti-arrhythmic drugs alone. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. A meta-analysis of improving total effects and reducing number of ventricular premature beats was performed to evaluate the effects of ZGC Decoction on PVCs. RESULTS: A total of 25 studies (involving 2441 patients) were included. The methodological quality of the included trials was evaluated as generally low. The results of the meta-analysis showed that ZGC Decoction combined with anti-arrhythmic drugs had significant effect on improving total effects (RR: 1.30 [1.22, 1.38]; P<0.00001) and relieving number of ventricular premature beats (MD: -6.66 [-12.94, -0.37]; P=0.04) compared with anti-arrhythmic drugs alone. Our review showed that ZGC Decoction was more effective in improving total effects (RR: 1.22 [1.08, 1.37]; P=0.0009), compared with anti-arrhythmic drugs alone. 13 trials reported adverse events, while the others did not mention them, indicating that the safety of ZGC Decoction remains uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: ZGC Decoction appears to have beneficial effects on improvement of total effects, reduction of number of ventricular premature beats in participants with PVCs. However, further thorough investigation, large-scale, proper study designed, randomized trials of ZGC Decoction for PVCs will be required to justify the effects reported.

26504476|t|Erchen Decoction Prevents High-Fat Diet Induced Metabolic Disorders in C57BL/6 Mice.
26504476|a|Erchen decoction (ECD) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, which is used in the treatment of obesity, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases caused by retention of phlegm dampness. In this study we investigated the potential mechanism of ECD, using metabolism-disabled mice induced by high-fat diet. Body weight and abdominal circumference were detected. OGTT was measured by means of collecting blood samples from the tail vein. Blood lipid levels and insulin were measured using biochemical assay kit. Real-time PCR was used to measure the CDKAL1 gene expression and western blot was used to measure the protein expression. Through the research, it was found that ECD showed markedly lower body weight and abdominal circumference than those in the HFD group. Consistently, we observed that ECD significantly improved glucose tolerance, promoted the secretion of insulin and decreased the level of TG, TC level. Meanwhile, we observed significantly increased CDKAL1 mRNA and protein level in the ECD group. Therefore, we speculate that the potential molecular mechanism of ECD is to promote the CDKAL1 expression, ameliorate islet cell function, and raise insulin levels to regulate the metabolic disorder.

33350195|t|[Mechanism and experimental verification of Sijunzi Decoction in treatment of ulcerative colitis based on network pharmacology].
33350195|a|To explore the mechanism of Sijunzi Decoction in the treatment of ulcerative colitis(UC) based on network pharmacology. The active components and corresponding targets of Sijunzi Decoction were extracted with Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform(TCMSP), and the targets were standardized with the help of Uniprot database. The related targets of UC were obtained through GeneCards database and Disgenet database, and the intersection targets of drugs and diseases were screened by R language. The visual regulation network of "active ingredient-disease target" of Sijunzi Decoction was constructed by Cytoscape software, and the protein-protein interaction network was constructed by STRING database. The functional enrichment analysis of gene ontology(GO) and the enrichment analysis of Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes(KEGG) pathway were carried out on Bioconductor platform, and some of the targets were verified by animal experiments. Through database analysis, a total of 135 active components of Sijunzi Decoction, 114 predicted targets and 80 common targets with UC were obtained. The core target proteins included interleukin 6(IL-6), caspase-3(CASP3), vascular endothelial growth factor A(VEGFA), epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) and so on. GO functional enrichment analysis involved 102 items, which mainly affected transcription factor activity, enzyme activity, receptor activity and biochemical process regulation. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that 120 items were involved in human cytomegalovirus infection, cancer, apoptosis, inflammation and other pathways. Mouse experiments showed that Sijunzi Decoction could down-regulate the expression of target proteins IL-6 and caspase-3 and inhibit intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis. The treatment of UC with Sijunzi Decoction is the result of the interaction among multi-components, multi-targets and multi-pathways. It is proved by experiments that Sijunzi Decoction may play an effective role by regulating the expression of IL-6 and caspase-3, and getting involved in apoptosis, inflammation and other pathways.

30524483|t|Sipjeondaebo-tang Alleviates Oxidative Stress-Mediated Liver Injury through Activation of the CaMKK2-AMPK Signaling Pathway.
30524483|a|Sipjeondaebo-tang (SDT) is used frequently as a herbal prescription to treat deficiency syndromes in traditional Korean medicine. We investigated the hepatoprotective effects of SDT against oxidative stress and attempted to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms. SDT pretreatment reduced arachidonic acid (AA) plus iron-mediated cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner and prevented changes in apoptosis-related protein expression. In addition, SDT pretreatment significantly reduced glutathione depletion, hydrogen peroxide production, and mitochondrial dysfunction via treatment with AA plus iron. SDT increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in accordance with the phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2). Experiments using an AMPK chemical inhibitor (Compound C) or CaMKK2 chemical inhibitor (STO-609) suggested that the CaMKK2-AMPK signaling pathway contributes to SDT-mediated protection of mitochondria and cells. Moreover, administration of SDT for 4 consecutive days to mice significantly reduced the alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities induced by carbon tetrachloride, and the numbers of degenerated hepatocytes, infiltrated inflammatory cells, nitrotyrosine-positive cells, and 4-hydroxynonenal-positive cells in liver tissue. Therefore, SDT protects hepatocytes from oxidative stress via CaMKK2-dependent AMPK activation and has the therapeutic potential to prevent or treat oxidative stress-related liver injury.

26884944|t|Interventional effects of da-cheng-qi decoction on enteric nerve system in a rat model of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
26884944|a|In this study, we investigate the morphologic changes of enteric nerve system (ENS) and the expression of neurotransmitters, acetylcholine (ACh), substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), in small bowel of rats undergoing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Undergoing MODS, fluorescence integral optical density (IOD) value of enteric nerve fibers were significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the network structure of ENS was destroyed. The expression of ACh, SP, VIP and NOS was inhibited, IOD value of the four neurotransmitters was significantly decreased (P<0.05). After intervention of DCQD, the fluorescence IOD value of enteric nerves were significantly increased (P<0.05), and the network structure of ENS was repaired. The expression of ACh, SP, VIP and NOS was recovered, fluorescence IOD value of the four neurotransmitters was significantly increased (P<0.05). In conclusion, the gastrointestinal motility disorders undergoing MODS may be closely related to the morphology destroy of ENS and down regulation of neurotransmitters (ACh, SP, VIP and NOS) expression. DCQD could promote gastrointestinal motility through protecting the morphology of ENS and up regulation of neurotransmitters (ACh, SP, VIP and NOS) expression.

16552830|t|Effects of switching to wen-jing-tang (unkei-to) from preceding herbal preparations selected by eight-principle pattern identification on endocrinological status and ovulatory induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
16552830|a|The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of switching therapy to wen-jing-tang (unkei-to) from previous selected herbal preparations on endocrine levels and induction of ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Sixty-four anovulatory women diagnosed with PCOS were enrolled in the study. After Kampo diagnosis, subjects received matched Kampo preparations (43 cases: dang-gui-shao-yao-san, 21 cases: gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan) selected by the matching theory of eight-principle pattern identification and Kampo diagnosis based on concepts of the qi, blood, and fluids as the physiologic activity. Fifty-four women who failed to ovulate after an 8-week treatment were randomly allocated to continuation of treatment with the preceding Kampo prescription (continuation group, n = 27) or treatment with wen-jing-tang (switching group, n = 27). Plasma FSH, LH and estradiol levels were measured and ovulation rates were determined at the beginning and after an 8-week treatment with the preceding Kampo prescription, as well as after the subsequent 8-week treatment with the same preparation or wen-jing-tang. No decrease in mean plasma LH level was observed in the 54 women who failed to ovulate among the 64 treated with a Kampo preparation. After the 8-week treatment with wen-jing-tang, plasma LH levels were decreased by 58.2% (p < 0.0001) and 49.4% (p = 0.0005) in the groups switched from dang-gui-shao-yao-san and gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan, respectively. In the group switched from dang-gui-shao-yao-san, a tendency towards increase in plasma estradiol level was observed (1.51-fold, p = 0.055), which was significant compared with that in the group switched from gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan (p = 0.032). The ovulation rate with switching of treatment to wen-jing-tang was significantly higher (59.3%) than that with continued use of the same preparation (7.4%, p = 0.0036). This study confirmed that wen-jing-tang was effective in improving endocrine condition in the treatment of disturbances of ovulation in patients with PCOS without taking eight-principle pattern identification into consideration. This finding indicates that wen-jing-tang is appropriate for use in treating PCOS in women with various constitutions (as determined by the matching theory of eight-principle pattern identification) in clinical practice and may prove to be a potent therapeutic agent with a wide therapeutic spectrum.

32973506|t|Maimendong Decoction Improves Pulmonary Function in Rats With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis by Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in AECIIs.
32973506|a|This study was designed to investigate the mechanism by which MMDD improves lung function, and observe the effect of MMDD on endoplasmic reticulum stress(ERS) in alveolar type II epithelial cells (AECIIs) of pulmonary fibrosis rats. pulmonary fibrosis animal model was established by intratracheal injection of BLM at a dose of 6mg/kg body weight. Overall, Thirty male SPF Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control group, BLM group and BLM+MMDD group. BLM+MMDD group rats were fed 24 g/kg over three weeks for twice a day on the fourteenth day after model establishment. MMDD improves pulmonary function of fibrotic rats and reduces the occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum stress in AECIIs. MMDD could significantly improve the forced vital capacity (FVC) of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. MMDD reduced the expression of GRP78 and CHOP in AECIIs, increased the secretion of surfactant protein C (SPC) by AECIIs. Moreover, the apoptosis of the fibrosis zone in the lung tissue was remarkably mitigated by administration of MMDD. The finding of this study revealed that MMDD can improve lung function in rats with pulmonary fibrosis by reducing the occurrence of ERS and cell apoptosis of AECIIs. It may provide a new method for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

31718632|t|Sheng Mai San protects H9C2 cells against hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis.
31718632|a|BACKGROUND: Sheng Mai San (SMS) has been proven to exhibit cardio-protective effects. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of SMS on hyperglycaemia (HG)-induced apoptosis in H9C2 cells. METHODS: HG-induced H9C2 cells were established as the experimental model, and then treated with SMS at 25, 50, and 100 mug/mL. H9C2 cell viability and apoptosis were quantified using MTT and Annexin V-FITC assays, respectively. Furthermore, Bcl-2/Bax signalling pathway protein expression and Fas and FasL gene expression levels were quantified using western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: SMS treatments at 25, 50, 100 mug/mL significantly improved H9C2 cell viability and inhibited H9C2 cell apoptosis (p < 0.05). Compared to the HG group, SMS treatment at 25, 50, and 100 mug/mL significantly downregulated p53 and Bax expression and upregulated Bcl-2 expression (p < 0.05). Moreover, SMS treatment at 100 mug/mL significantly downregulated Fas and FasL expression level (p < 0.05) when compared to the HG group. CONCLUSION: SMS protects H9C2 cells from HG-induced apoptosis probably by downregulating p53 expression and upregulating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. It may also be associated with the inhibition of the Fas/FasL signalling pathway.

33762939|t|Biejiajian Pill Inhibits Carcinogenesis and Metastasis via the Akt/GSK-3beta/Snail Signaling Pathway in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
33762939|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most usual cancers globally. In China, Biejiajian pill (BJJP), Traditional Chinese Medicine clinical prescription, is broadly utilized for the prevention and therapy of HCC. However, the mechanisms by which BJJP exerts its effects on the prevention of tumor invasion and metastasis are still largely unknown. In this study, in vitro multiple hepatic cancer cell lines and an in vivo xenograft mice model were used to validate the preventive effects and molecular mechanisms of BJJP in HCC. We established that BJJP significantly repressed the proliferation, metastasis and infiltration of HCC cells. Furthermore, BJJP remarkably suppressed HCC cell migration, as well as invasion via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by modulating Snail expression, which was associated with the repression of Akt/GSK-3beta/Snail signaling axis activation. In vivo HCC xenograft results indicated that BJJP delayed HCC development and efficiently inhibited lung metastasis. Taken together, BJJP was shown to be an effective therapeutic agent against HCC through repression of the Akt/GSK-3beta/Snail signaling cascade and EMT.

29093618|t|Optimal timing for the oral administration of Da-Cheng-Qi decoction based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targeting of the pancreas in rats with acute pancreatitis.
29093618|a|AIM: To identify the optimal oral dosing time of Da-Cheng-Qi decoction (DCQD) in rats with acute pancreatitis (AP) based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. METHODS: First, 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a sham-operated group [NG(a)] and three model groups [4hG(a), 12hG(a) and 24hG(a)]. The NG(a) and model groups were administered DCQD (10 g/kg.BW) intragastrically at 4 h, 4 h, 12 h and 24 h, respectively, after AP models induced by 3% sodium taurocholate. Plasma samples were collected from the tails at 10 min, 20 min, 40 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after a single dosing with DCQD. Plasma and pancreatic tissue concentrations of the major components of DCQD were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy. The pharmacokinetic parameters and serum amylase were detected and compared. Second, rats were divided into a sham-operated group [NG(b)] and three treatment groups [4hG(b), 12hG(b) and 24hG(b)] with three corresponding control groups [MG(b)s]. Blood and pancreatic tissues were collected 24 h after a single dosing with DCQD. Serum amylase, inflammatory cytokines and pathological scores of pancreatic tissues were detected and compared. RESULTS: The concentrations of emodin, naringin, honokiol, naringenin, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol and rheochrysidin in the 12hG(a) group were higher than those in the 4hG(a) group in the pancreatic tissues (P < 0.05). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration values (AUC0-->t) for rhein, chrysophanol, magnolol and naringin in the 12hG(a) group were larger than those in the 4hG(a) or 24hG(a) groups. The 12hG(a) group had a higher Cmax than the other two model groups. The IL-10 levels in the 12hG(b) and 24hG(b) groups were higher than in the MG(b)s (96.55 +/- 7.84 vs 77.46 +/- 7.42, 251.22 +/- 16.15 vs 99.72 +/- 4.7 respectively, P < 0.05), while in the 24hG(b) group, the IL-10 level was higher than in the other two treatment groups (251.22 +/- 16.15 vs 154.41 +/- 12.09/96.55 +/- 7.84, P < 0.05). The IL-6 levels displayed a decrease in the 4hG(b) and 12hG(b) groups compared to the MG(b)s (89.99 +/- 4.61 vs 147.91 +/- 4.36, 90.82 +/- 5.34 vs 171.44 +/- 13.43, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Late-time dosing may have higher concentrations of the most major components of DCQD, with better pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-inflammation than early-time dosing, which showed the late time to be the optimal dosing time of DCQD for AP.

2630777|t|[A case of pneumonitis due to sho-saiko-to].
2630777|a|We reported a case of pneumonitis due to Sho-saiko-to. A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of pneumonia. She complained of dry cough, pyrexia and severe dyspnea. Fine crepitation was heard on physical examination of the chest and a chest X-ray film revealed diffuse reticulo-nodular shadow in both lung fields. We suspected summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis and followed her up, however her condition deteriorated. Under a suspicion of drug-induced pneumonitis, all drugs were stopped and she was given prednisolone. Consequently her complaints, laboratory data and chest X-ray findings markedly improved. Microscopic examination of a transbronchial lung biopsy specimens showed interstitial pneumonitis. The results of a lymphocyte stimulation test were positive for sho-saiko-to. She gave informed consent after receiving an explanation of the challenge test. She was tested with 2.5 g sho-saiko-to twice and developed high fever and dyspnea with hypoxia, while the chest X-ray film also revealed diffuse infiltrative shadows similar that on admission. Based on these findings, we diagnosed this case as pneumonitis due to sho-saiko-to. To our knowledge, there has been no previous case of pulmonary hypersensitivity due to sho-saiko-to reported in the world.

30046342|t|Xihuang Pill Induces Apoptosis of Human Glioblastoma U-87 MG Cells via Targeting ROS-Mediated Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 Pathway.
30046342|a|Xihuang pill (XHP), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, has long been used as an effective agent against multiple tumors. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of XHP on the growth inhibition and apoptosis in glioblastoma U-87 MG cells. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed for constituent analysis of XHP. Cell viability, cell cycle arrest, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 assay, PI/RNase staining, DCFH-DA assay, TUNEL assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, and JC-1 assay, respectively. The role of XHP in the regulation of Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 interaction was clarified by using Western Blotting (WB), immunofluorescence (IF), pharmacological inhibitor or antioxidant, and siRNA silencing. The results suggested that XHP could inhibit U-87 MG cells growth and arrest cells in S-phase cell cycle significantly and that the generation of ROS, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, enhancement of Bax/Bcl-xL ratio, and reduction of the precursor forms of caspase-9 and caspase-3 caused by XHP prompted that a ROS-mediated mitochondria-dependent apoptosis was possibly involved. Furthermore, XHP affected the Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 pathway via inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and FOXO1 and increasing both prototype and nuclear translocation of FOXO1. Inhibition of Akt, mTOR, and FOXO1 by specific inhibitors or siRNA could interpose the apoptotic induction. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that XHP may regulate glioblastoma U-87 MG cell apoptosis via ROS-mediated Akt/mTOR/FOXO1 pathway.

24864160|t|Wen-dan decoction improves negative emotions in sleep-deprived rats by regulating orexin-a and leptin expression.
24864160|a|Wen-Dan Decoction (WDD), a formula of traditional Chinese medicine, has been clinically used for treating insomnia for approximately 800 years. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of WDD remain unclear. Orexin-A plays a key role in the sleep-wake cycle, while leptin function is opposite to orexin-A. Thus, orexin-A and leptin may be important factors in sleep disorders. In this study, 48 rats were divided into control, model, WDD-treated, and diazepam-treated groups. The model of insomnia was produced by sleep deprivation (SD) for 14 days. The expressions of orexin-A, leptin, and their receptors in blood serum, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and real time PCR. Open field tests showed that SD increased both crossing movement (Cm) and rearing-movement (Rm) times. Orexin-A and leptin levels in blood serum increased after SD but decreased in brain compared to the control group. mRNA expressions of orexin receptor 1 and leptin receptor after SD were decreased in the prefrontal cortex but were increased in hypothalamus. WDD treatment normalized the behavior and upregulated orexin-A, leptin, orexin receptor 1 and leptin receptor in brain. The findings suggest that WDD treatment may regulate SD-induced negative emotions by regulating orexin-A and leptin expression.

33667569|t|Integrated serum pharmacochemistry and network pharmacological analysis used to explore possible anti-rheumatoid arthritis mechanisms of the Shentong-Zhuyu decoction.
33667569|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shentong-Zhuyu decoction (STZYD) has been recognized by the Chinese National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as a classic TCM formula. Use of STZYD has shown a satisfactory clinical therapeutic outcome for rheumatoid arthritis (RA); despite this, its bioactive chemical composition and relevant mechanism(s) of this action have not been clearly elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the bioactive chemical composition of STZYD used for RA treatment and its possible mechanism(s) of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum pharmacochemistry mediated by the UPLC-Q-Exactive MS/MS method was employed to identify the absorbed phytochemical compounds in serum derived from STZYD, which were commonly considered as the potential bioactive compounds. And then, these components were used to construct a compound-target network for RA using a network pharmacology approach, to predict the possible biological targets of STZYD along with potential signaling pathways. Afterwards, we established a Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced RA rat model, and observed the anti-RA effect of STZYD by a series of indexes, including foot swelling, ankle diameter, arthritis score, morphological and radiographic analysis, serum inflammatory factors, and histopathological analysis of synovial tissues. Particularly, the predicted pathway by the combination of serum pharmacochemistry and network pharmacology was further validated using RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses in animal experiment. RESULTS: Totally, 38 compounds derived from STZYD have been identified by serum sample analysis. Based on it, 387 genes related to these identified compounds in STZYD and 3807 genes related to RA were collected by network pharmacology. Critically, KEGG analysis indicated that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was recommended as one of the main pathway related to anti-RA effect of STZYD. Experimentally, STZYD significantly alleviated CFA-induced arthritis without any visible side-effects. Compared to the RA model group without any treatment, the treatment of STZYD significantly reduced the expression of both mRNA and protein targets in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, this result was also corroborated by immunohistochemistry analysis. All these studies could effectively corroborate the predicted result as above, suggested that the feasibility of this integrated strategy. CONCLUSION: This study provided a useful strategy to identify bioactive compounds and the potential mechanisms for TCM formula by integrating serum pharmacochemistry and network pharmacology.

27382298|t|XuefuZhuyu Tang exerts antitumor effects by inhibiting glioma cell metastasis and invasion via regulating tumor microenvironment.
27382298|a|BACKGROUND: XuefuZhuyu Tang (XZT) is a traditional Chinese herb used for destagnation and is currently being used for oncotherapy. This study was intended to assess the effects of XZT on glioma along with its anticancer mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U251 cells were divided into five groups: CNC (cells were cultured with normal saline), TSC (cells were treated with TaohongSiwu Tang [TST]), XSC (cells were treated with XZT), THC (cells were treated with homogenate of TST), and XHC (cells were treated with homogenate of XZT). The mRNA and protein expression of VEGF/VEGFR, CXCR4/CXCL12, and TIMP1/MMP9/MMP2 were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. Moreover, MTT assay, transwell assay, wound-healing assay, and flow cytometry were conducted to assess the cell viability, cell migration and invasion, cell motility, and cell apoptosis of U251 cells, respectively. In vivo, three mice models (group CNM, gavaging saline; group TSM, gavaging TST; group XZM, gavaging XZT) were constructed after establishing xenograft mice models. Then, models were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. RESULTS: In vitro, XZT significantly upregulated TIMP1 expression and downregulated the expression of VEGF, VEGFR, CXCR4, CXCL12, MMP9, and MMP2 in U251 cells (all P<0.05). In addition, XZT inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and induced cell apoptosis. In vivo, the average expression level of VEGF, CXCL12, MMP9, and MMP2 was downregulated in the XZM group compared with the control and TSM groups (all P<0.05). Tumor volumes in the XZM group were significantly lower than those in the CNM and TSM groups (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: XZT may suppress glioma growth and decrease expression levels of VEGF, CXCL12, MMP9, and MMP2. We speculate that XZT may be a potential therapeutic herb for curing glioma.

15256755|a|Effect of Mao-Bushi-Saishin-to (Ma-Huang-Fu-Zi-Xi-Xin-Tang: MBS) on prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production was investigated using C6 rat glioma cells. Mao or Saishin inhibited histamine-induced PGE(2) production while MBS slightly decreased and Bushi increased it. MBS and Mao inhibited and Bushi enhanced A23187-induced PGE(2) production while Saishin had no effect. Concomitantly, Mao inhibted, but Bushi fascilitated, histamine- and A23187-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. Treatment of MBS, Mao and also Saishin increased cAMP content. From these results, MBS inhibit PGE(2) production in C6 cells, mainly due to Mao but also due to Saishin at least in part, and the counteraction of Bushi. The former effect is mediated by formation of cAMP and resulting inhibition of ERK1/2-phosphorylation.

25509301|t|[Changes in Wnt pathway inhibiting factors in nitrosamine-induced esophageal precancerosis lesions and effect of gexia zhuyu decoction].
25509301|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the changes in Wnt pathway inhibiting factors in esophageal precancerosis lesions induced by methyl benzyl nitrosamine (MBNA) and the effect of Gexia Zhuyu decoction. METHOD: Wistar rats were subcutaneously injected with MBNA (3.5 mg x kg(-1) for twice per week to establish the model. Since the 1st day after the model establishment, they were orally administered with Gexia Zhuyu decoction (16, 8 mg x kg(-1)). At the 10th week, esophageal tissues were collected to observe the pathological changes of esophageal mucosa, detect SFRP1, sFRP4, Axin1, Axin2 and GSK-3beta mRNA levels.by fluorescent quantitation PCR analysis and beta-catenin protein level by Western blotting. RESULT: Being induced by MBNA, rats in the model group showed slight atypical hyperplasia in the histopathological examination. Compared with the normal group, Gexia Zhuyu decoction dose high and low groups showed no significant pathomorphological and histological changes. The model group showed lower gene transcription levels of esophageal tissues sFRP1, sFRP4, Axin1 and Axin2 (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) and higher beta-catenin protein expression level (P < 0.01) than the normal control group. The Gexia Zhuyu decoction low dose group showed higher gene transcription levels of esophageal tissues sFRP1, sFRP4, Axin1 and Axin2 (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) and lower beta-catenin protein expression level (P < 0.01) than the normal control group. CONCLUSION: Up-regulated beta-catenin protein level and down-regulated Wnt pathway could enhance Wnt pathway activity of MBNA-induced esophageal precancerous lesions. Gexia Zhuyu decoction could down-regulate the beta-catenin protein level and up-regulate the transcription level of Wnt pathway inhibiting factors, but could not block MBNA-induced esophageal precancerosis lesions.

11977541|a|Myalgia/arthralgia is a crucial side effect of paclitaxel, and may become the major dose-limiting side effect. However, this is a situation where there is little effective preventive treatment. L-Glutamine was reported as a neuroprotective agent for vincristine-induced neurotoxicity. In Japan, there have been reports on steroid and Shakuyaku-Kanzou-to (a herbal medicine) for paclitaxel-induced myalgia/arthralgia. This study aimed to compare the effect of L-Glutamine and Shakuyaku-Kanzou-to, and to discuss the validity of these agents for the paclitaxel-induced myalgia/arthralgia. Our results suggested that Shakuyaku-Kanzou-to showed no remarkable effects against paclitaxel-induced myalgia/arthralgia as had been reported before; however, both L-Glutamine and Shakuyaku-Kanzou-to decreased the duration of grade 2 toxicity (CALGB Expanded Common Toxicity Criteria) in comparison with those who were not treated. L-Glutamine and Shakuyaku-Kanzou-to might therefore a preventive effect against moderate or severer myalgia/arthralgia during paclitaxel-treated chemotherapy. Further trials are needed to confirm the value of these drugs.

28589702|t|Choto-san versus placebo for patients with dementia: systematic review and meta-analysis.
28589702|a|BACKGROUND: Choto-san is a traditional medicine used for hypertension and headaches in Japan and China. Some studies have shown its effectiveness in the treatment of dementia. The present review aimed to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of Choto-san in the treatment of adults with cognitive impairment. METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials comparing Choto-san with placebo for patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials evaluating 219 participants were included. Two were studies on vascular dementia, and the other was on Alzheimer's dementia. There was no difference between Choto-san and placebo in terms of short-term dichotomous judgement of improvement, but Choto-san was more effective than placebo in terms of short-term improvement of cognitive function as measured by continuous outcomes. Also, dropouts judged it to be acceptable. However, the results were imprecise and/or heterogeneous. The number of participants included in the analysis was small (n = 199 in the primary analysis) and sometimes inconsistent, as indicated by the large I (2) (72% in the primary analysis). CONCLUSION: Low-quality evidence was suggestive of Choto-san's efficacy for vascular dementia, but the present results may be overestimated. Studies with a larger sample size and conducted over longer periods should be performed. Regardless, Choto-san can be one of the choices for the treatment of vascular dementia as it is well tolerated.

15015378|t|[A comparison of the protective activity of liver injury induced by D-galact-osamine between huangqin-tang and their metabolites by human intestinal bacteria].
15015378|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the protective activity of liver injury induced by D-galactosamine (GalN) between Huangqin-Tang and their metabolites by human intestinal bacteria(HIB). METHOD: The liver injuries in conventional and pseudo-germfree mice were induced by GalN. After oral administration of Huangqin-Tang and their metabolites mixtures by HIB, the serum transaminase (ALT and AST) activities were detected. RESULT: In conventional mice, large and medium doses (20 and 10 g.kg-1) of Huangqin-Tang decoction significantly reduced the increase of serum ALT activity after 18 h GalN treatment. In pseudo-germfree mice, metabolites significantly reduced the ALT levels. However, Huangqing-Tang didn't affect the ALT levels in this kind of mice. To all of the animals, AST levels remained the same after oral Huangqin-tang or their metabolites. CONCLUSION: The metabolism by intestinal bacteria plays a role in pharmacological effects of constituents of Chinese herbal medicine. The metabolites of the constituents by intestinal bacteria were the real active components in vivo.

34821108|a|Objective: To investigate the effects of Guipitang (GPT) on myocardial ischemic (MI) injury of rats. Methods: Forty male SD rats were randomly divided into five groups as control, model, GPT low-dose and high-dose groups (7.52, 15.04 g/kg), and positive-drug trimetazidine group (2 mg/kg). Rat myocardial ischemia model was induced by feeding high fat forage and intraperitoneal injection of isoprenaline (ISO). After 15 days intragastric administration, rats were injected with ISO once a day for 3 days again. Subsequently, Electrocardiograph (ECG) was examined, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and glucose (GLU) were detected using an automatic biochemical analyzer. The histopathological alterations of heart were assessed using HE and Masson staining. The protein expressions of Collagen I and Collagen III in heart were evaluated by Western blot. Results: Compared with control group, the electrocardiogram S-T segment of model rats moved down, the serum levels of TC, AST, CK, LDH and GLU in model group were increased significantly (P0.05), the expressions of collagen I and collagen III in heart were increased (P0.05), and the hearts were damaged severely. However, no significant changes of TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and ALT were observed (P0.05). Compared with the model group, the high and low dose groups of GPT and trimetazidine could inhibit the descent of S-T segment, reduced serum TC, AST, CK, LDH and GLU levels (P0.05), and decreased collagen III expression in heart (P0.05), and alleviated myocardial pathological damage as well. The high dose group of GPT could decrease the protein expression of collagen I. Conclusion: GPT could improve heart function and alleviate the injury of myocardial ischemia, especially the high lose.

35219821|t|Shenling Baizhu San ameliorates ulcerative colitis by regulating the gut microbiota and its tryptophan metabolites: A complementary medicine to mesalamine.
35219821|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shenling Baizhu San (SBS) is commonly employed to improve gastrointestinal dysfunction in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in China. SBS combined with mesalamine has been demonstrated to result in improve its curative effects without increasing any adverse reactions, but the underlying mechanism remains unclarified. AIM OF THE STUDY: Our study aimed to illuminate the potential therapeutic effects and mechanisms of SBS, which is a medicine complementary to mesalamine, in the treatment of UC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of SBS as a complementary medicine to mesalamine for patients with UC (n = 48). The patients in the control group (n = 24) were given mesalamine alone, whereas those in the experimental group were administered mesalamine combined with SBS. The therapeutic outcome was assessed at 8 weeks. The structures of the gut microbiota (GMB) were characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing, and the microbial tryptophan metabolites were analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS to investigate the mechanism through which SBS achieves its effects. RESULTS: Our results showed that the combination of SBS and mesalamine could significantly improve the clinical signs of UC by achieving mucosal healing and relieving colon damage. Interestingly, the combination of SBS and mesalamine could alter the GMB structures and increase the microbial levels of tryptophan metabolites, including indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-acetic acid. CONCLUSION: SBS combined with mesalamine is effective in improving the clinical and endoscopic outcomes of patients with UC. SBS, as a complementary therapy to conventional treatment, alleviates UC via the GMB-tryptophan metabolite axis.

11117269|t|The effect of Chinese herbal medicine, xiao-qing-long tang (XQLT), on allergen-induced bronchial inflammation in mite-sensitized mice.
11117269|a|BACKGROUND: There are detailed descriptions of the clinical experiences and prescriptions of asthma in traditional Chinese medicine. Xiao-qing-long tang (XQLT), or sho-seiryo-to by its Japanese name, is one of the Chinese herbal medicines used to treat bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis for centuries. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of this medication are still far from clear. In this study, a house-dust-mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus [Der p])-sensitized murine model of asthma was used to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of XQLT on the allergen-induced airway inflammation in asthma. METHODS: Three different protocols were designed to evaluate the treatment and/ or long-term prophylactic effect of XQLT in Der p-sensitized mice. XQLT extracts (1 gm/kg) were administered to sensitized mice 1 h before allergen challenge (AC) (group A), 24 h after AC (group B), and every other day six times before AC (group C), respectively. Cellular infiltration and T-cell subsets in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of allergen-challenged mice were analyzed. Intrapulmonary lymphocytes were also isolated to evaluate their response to allergen stimulation. RESULTS: When XQLT was administered to the sensitized mice before AC (groups A and C), it suppressed airway inflammation by decreasing the number of total cells and eosinophil infiltration in the BALF, and downregulated the allergen- or mitogen-induced intrapulmonary lymphocyte response of sensitized mice as compared to those of controls. This immunomodulatory effect of XQLT may be exerted through the regulation of T-cell subsets by elevation or activation of the CD8+ and double-negative T-cell population in the lung. However, the administration of XQLT to sensitized mice 24 h after AC (group B) did not have the same inhibitory effect on the airway inflammation as XQLT given before AC. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of XQLT before AC has the immunomodulatory effect of reducing bronchial inflammation in the allergen-sensitized mice.

8821988|a|We encountered five cases of drug-induced pneumonitis due to Sho-saiko-to or interferon-alpha or both. In all 5 cases the underlying disease was chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C virus. Interferon-alpha alone was administered in one case, Sho-saiko-to alone was administered in two cases, and both were administered in two cases. Bronchoalveolar lavage was done in 4 cases. In three cases, lymphocytosis and abnormally low CD4/8 ratios were found on examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In the only case in which interferon-alpha alone was given the percentage of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was abnormally high, and the adult respiratory distress syndrome developed. Lymphocyte stimulation tests were done in four cases, and in all four cases the only positive results were against Sho-saiko-to or against interferon-alpha. The frequency of drug-induced pneumonitis among patients with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis was 0.7% in those given only Sho-saiko-to, 0.5% in those given only interferon-alpha, and 4.0% in those given both interferon-alpha and Sho-saiko-to. Therefore, pneumonitis due to Sho-saiko-to and to interferon-alpha is more likely to occur if these two drugs are given simultaneously.

33164394|t|[Exploration on mechanisms of Xiaoyao Powder in treating atherosclerosis and depressive disorder with concept of "treating different diseases with same method" based on network pharmacology].
33164394|a|The aim of this paper was to explore the mechanism of Xiaoyao Powder in treating atherosclerosis and depressive disorder with concept of "treating different diseases with same method" based on network pharmacology. TCMSP(Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform) and SymMap databases were used to search all the chemical components and targets related to Xiaoyao Powder. After preliminary screening, the network of "herbs-compounds-targets" was constructed. Through DisGeNET, CTD(Comparative Toxicogenomics Database) and TTD(Therapeutic Target Database), the targets of atherosclerosis and depressive disorder were obtained. The common targets were obtained by intersecting the herbal targets and disease targets. In order to screen the key common targets, STRING and Cytoscape were used to analyze the protein-protein interaction of common targets. BioGPS was used to obtain their distribution information in organs and tissues. Gene ontology(GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes(KEGG) analysis were conducted through Metascape. About 1 355 compounds of Xiaoyao Powder were found by TCMSP and Symmap database; 161 active compounds were screened out according to standard of oral bioavailability>/=30% and drug like index>/=0.18; 274 herbal targets were obtained and the "herbs-compounds-targets" network was constructed. About 1 004 atherosclerosis targets and 578 depressive disorder targets were obtained, and 37 common targets were obtained after intersection with herbal targets. By using STRING and Cytoscape for protein-protein interaction analysis, 18 key targets were screened. BioGPS showed that the key common targets were mainly distributed in heart, amygdala, pineal, liver and smooth muscle. Metascape was used for GO enrichment analysis and the results showed that there were 929 biological processes, 25 cell components and 23 molecular functions. Enrichment ana-lysis of KEGG showed that there were 108 signal pathways such as AGE-RAGE, HIF-1, FoxO, Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17 signal pathways, which were mainly related to neuroendocrine system, metabolism, immune inflammation and oxidative stress. In conclusion, the main mechanism of Xiaoyao Powder in treating atherosclerosis and depressive disorder with concept of "treating different diseases with same method" was related to neuroendocrine system, metabolism, immune inflammation and oxidative stress-related signal pathway, providing reference for further experimental verification, potential pharmacological mechanism and clinical application.

28712265|a|PURPOSE: Jaeumganghwa-Tang (JGT), a traditional herbal formula composed of 12 medicinal herbs, is used for the treatment of age-related diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of JGT on muscle mass and function in aged mice. METHODS: Young (5-month-old) and old (19-month-old) male C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups each; one group received JGT (75 mg/d) and the other group received the vehicle for 6 weeks. At the end of the experimental period, muscle strength was examined using the wire hang test, and the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles were weighed. Muscle samples were further used for histological analysis to assess muscle damage, and the expression of transforming growth factor-beta was investigated via western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Our results showed that treatment of old mice with JGT improved muscle strength, increased skeletal muscle mass, alleviated muscle damage, and suppressed intramuscular expression of transforming growth factor-beta. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, JGT has beneficial effects on age-related loss of muscle mass and function. Thus, it might serve as a potential therapeutic agent for sarcopenia.

29329611|t|Early intervention with Didang decoction delays macrovascular lesions in diabetic rats through regulating AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.
29329611|a|The study aimed to investigate the intervening role of Didang decoction (DDD) at different times in macrovascular endothelial defense function, focusing on its effects on the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. The effects of DDD on mitochondrial energy metabolism were also investigated in rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs). Type 2 diabetes were induced in rats by streptozotocin (STZ) combined with high fat diet. Rats were randomly divided into non-intervention group, metformin group, simvastatin group, and early-, middle-, late-stage DDD groups. Normal rats were used as control. All the rats received 12 weeks of intervention or control treatment. Western blots were used to detect the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha1 (AMPKalpha1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 1alpha (PGC-1alpha). Changes in the intracellular AMP and ATP levels were detected with ELISA. Real-time-PCR was used to detect the mRNA level of caspase-3, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and Bcl-2. Compared to the diabetic non-intervention group, a significant increase in the expression of AMPKalpha1 and PGC-1alpha were observed in the early-stage, middle-stage DDD groups and simvastatin group (P < 0.05). The levels of Bcl-2, eNOS, and ATP were significantly increased (P < 0.05), while the level of AMP and caspase-3 were decreased (P < 0.05) in the early-stage DDD group and simvastatin group. Early intervention with DDD enhances mitochondrial energy metabolism by regulating the AMPK signaling pathway and therefore may play a role in strengthening the defense function of large vascular endothelial cells and postpone the development of macrovascular diseases in diabetes.

35112334|t|Effect of diabetes blood-stasis syndrome and Xuefu Zhuyu decoction on ERK1/2-VEGF signal pathway in rat retina Muller cells.
35112334|a|AIMS: This research was aimed to investigate whether diabetic blood-stasis syndrome had a relationship with ERK1/2-VEGF signaling pathway in rat retina Muller cells and Traditional Chinese Drugs designed for promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis had effectiveness for diabetic retinopathy (DR) treatment. METHODS: Immunofluorescence was applied to determine purity of Muller cells. Muller cells were stimulated by blood serum obtained from rats with blood-stasis syndrome and then treated by Xuefu Zhuyu decoction. Western blot analysis, RT-PCR and ELISA were used to measure the expression of VEGF. Western blot analysis was used to determine the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. The status of AP-1 DNA binding activity was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). RESULTS: Stimulation of Muller cells by blood serum of rat with diabetic blood stasis increased the secretion of VEGF, activated ERK1/2 and AP-1 DNA-binding activity. And treatment of Xuefu Zhuyu decoction could weaken this phenomenon. What's more, ERK1/2 signaling pathway inhibitor U0126 also could inhibit the expression of VEGF. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic blood-stasis syndrome in theory of traditional Chinese Medicine has positive role in regulating ERK1/2-VEGF signaling pathway. Traditional Chinese drugs for promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis would be an effective therapy to treat DR.

12175519|t|Shimotsu-to is the agent in Juzen-taiho-to responsible for the prevention of endometrial carcinogenesis in mice.
12175519|a|We have found that Juzen-taiho-to has a preventive effect on endometrial carcinogenesis in mice (Carcinogenesis 22 (2001) 587). In the present study, the constituents of Juzen-taiho-to responsible for this effect were explored using a short-term experiment. Thirty female ICR mice were divided into five groups: Group 1 was given a diet containing 0.2% of Juzen-taiho-to and 5ppm estradiol-17beta (E(2)); Group 2 was given a diet containing Shimotsu-to (0.07%) and E(2) (5ppm); Group 3 received Shikunshi-to (0.08%) and E(2) (5ppm) in the diet; Group 4 was given 5ppm E(2) in the diet; and Group 5 served as a control. Exposure of Juzen-taiho-to or Shimotsu-to decreased E(2)-stimulated expression of estrogen-related gene c-fos mRNA (P<0.05), and the cytokines interleukin-1alpha mRNA and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA P<0.01). A similar trend was not found upon treatment with Shikunshi-to. These findings suggest that Shimotsu-to is responsible for the inhibitory effects of Juzen-taiho-to on the estrogen-related endometrial carcinogenesis in mice.

34217968|t|Protective effects of Da-cheng-qi decoction in rats with intracerebral hemorrhage.
34217968|a|BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most fatal subtype of stroke, has no disease-modifying treatment. Da-cheng-qi decoction (DCQ), composed of rhubarb, is one of the most commonly used Chinese traditional decoctions in ICH treatment. But the mechanism is not clear. Emodin is an active compound found in rhubarb. PURPOSE: To study the protective effects of DCQ on ICH and its possible mechanisms of action. METHODS: The ICH model was reproduced by injecting collagenase-VII into the left caudate putamen (CPu) of rats. DCQ and emodin were used to treat the ICH rats for 7 days. Behavior tests, proteomic analysis, morphological studies, and western blotting were performed. RESULTS: The neurological deficits in the ICH rats recovered with DCQ and emodin on the 14(th) day after ICH. The proteomics data revealed that DCQ significantly corrected the pathological signals in the CPu and hippocampus after ICH. The numbers of amoebic microglia in the CPu and M2 microglia in both CPu and hippocampus were significantly increased after DCQ and emodin treatment. The increase in GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor (NR2B) and postsynaptic density protein-95, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signals in the CPu, and secondary neurodegeneration (SND) in the hippocampus were significantly recovered in DCQ-treated rats. Inhibition of MAPK p38 (p38) in the hippocampus was observed after DCQ and emodin treatment. CONCLUSION: The protective effects of DCQ on ICH were confirmed in this study, and its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of MAPK and activation of M2 microglia. These results are beneficial to the development of ICH therapeutic targets.

11694034|t|The effects of Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang on respiratory resistance and airway leukocyte infiltration in asthmatic guinea pigs.
11694034|a|Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang (MXGST), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used in treatment of the bronchial asthma for several centuries. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of this Chinese medicine are still far from clear. To understand the mechanism of anti-asthmatic property of MXGST, a guinea pig model of allergic asthma was used to investigate the effects of MXGST on Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-induced early and late asthmatic responses and airway inflammation, and examine direct beta2-adrenoceptor agonist activity in guinea-pig isolated trachea. Administration of MXGST (10 g/kg) extracts significantly inhibited the antigen induced immediate asthmatic responses (IAR) in actively sensitized guinea pig. MXGST caused concentration-dependent relaxation in strips of guinea pig trachea contracted with carbachol, and ICI-118551, a selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, significantly inhibit the relaxation caused by MXGST. Furthermore, examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) revealed that MXGST significantly inhibited the increase in neutrophil in the airway at 1, 6 and 24 hr after antigen challenge. Histopathologic examination results showed that MXGST suppressed the neutrophil infiltration into lung tissue. In conclusion, we suggest that the anti-asthmatic effects of MXGST are mainly due to its stimulation of beta2-adrenoceptors on bronchial smooth muscle and its anti-inflammatory ability to inhibit the neutrophil into the airway. The precise mechanism of action of MXGST in asthma remains to be elucidated.

22687255|t|Metabonomic analysis of the therapeutic effect of Zhibai Dihuang Pill in treatment of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy.
22687255|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zhibai Dihuang Pill (ZDP) is one of ancient traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), which is usually used for the treatment of kidney deficiency for thousands of years in China. AIM OF THE STUDY: Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) usually operate in vivo through multi-components, multi-ways and multi-targets. However, the molecular mechanisms of TCMs remain unclear. In the present work, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomic analysis was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Zhibai Dihuang Pill (ZDP) on diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats induced by streptozotocin and to address the underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male rats were divided into three groups: control, DN and ZDP-treated DN (ZDP-DN), respectively. Based on (1)H NMR spectra of sera, urine and kidney extracts from the rats, principle component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify different metabolic profiles. Kidney portions and serum and urine samples were also subjected to histopathological or biochemical examination. RESULTS: PCA scores plots demonstrate that the cluster of DN rats is separated from that of control rats, while some of ZDP-DN rats are located close to control rats, indicating that metabolic profiles of these ZDP-DN rats are restored toward those of control rats. Our results illustrate that ZDP treatment could lower the levels of lipids and 3-hydrobutyrate, and raise the level of lactate in sera of DN rats. Moreover, ZDP treatment could also reduce the levels of glucose, 3-hydrobutyrate and lactate, enhance the level of betaine in kidney tissues. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that ZDP treatment can ameliorate DN symptoms by intervening in some dominating metabolic pathways, such as inhibiting glucose and lipid metabolism, enhancing methylamine metabolism. Our work may be of benefit to both evaluation of the therapeutic effect of TCM and elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanism.

28920352|t|[Effects of Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction on TLR signal pathway in gastric mucosa tissues of rats with Helicobacter pylori-induced chronic atrophic gastritis].
28920352|a|To explore the effects and mechanism of Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction on TLR signal pathway in gastric mucosa tissues of rats with Helicobacter pylori-related gastritis, sixty SD rats were randomly divided into control group, model group, high concentration of Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction group, moderate concentration of Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction group, low concentrations of Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction group and SB203580-treated group, with 10 rats in each group. SD rats of Hp-associated chronic atrophic gastritis models were established by intragastric gavage of Helicobacter pylori (HP) suspension. Changes in the gastric mucosa of rats were assessed by histopathology. ELISA was applied to detect the expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the serum, and the activity of iNOS in gastric mucosa. The content of NO in the gastric mucosa was tested by nitrate reductive enzymatic. The expressions of TLR2, TLR4, P38MAPK, NF-kappaB were detected by QPCR and Western-blot. The results indicated that the clinical symptoms of rats and pathological changes of gastric mucosa were improved in Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction group. Compared with normal control group, the protein expressions of TLR2, TLR4, p-P38MAPK and NF-kappaB in gastric mucosa of model group rats increased (P<0.01) with the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the serum, and the activity of iNOS and the content of NO in gastric mucosa increased. Compared with model group, the expressions decreased in Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction group, especially in the high concentration of Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction group(P<0.01), with gradually increased rate of HP eradication and decreased pathological grades of chronic atrophic gastritis. The serum level of TNF-alpha and IL-6 decreased from (24.313+/-2.261) mug*L (-)(1) to (15.195+/-1.235) mug*L-1(P<0.01) and from (77.416+/-8.095) mug*L (-)(1) to (33.150+/-2.532) mug*L (-)(1) (P<0.01), and the activity of iNOS and the content of NO in gastric mucosa decreased from (1.530+/-0.206) U*mg (-)(1) to (0.802+/-0.091) U*mg (-)(1) (P<0.01) and from (0.907+/-0.032) mmol*g (-)(1) to (0.335+/-0.026) mmol*g (-)(1) (P<0.01) after the treatment of high concentration of Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction. All the effects increased with the increasing dosage of Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction from 0.324 g*mg (-)(1) to 1.296 g*mg (-)(1). The protein expressions of NF-kappaB decreased in the gastric mucosa after treated with P38MAPK specific inhibitor-SB203580. In the rats model, HP infection results in chronic atrophic gastritis through the activation of TLR2, TLR4/MAPK/NF-kappaB/iNOS/NO signal pathway. Xiangsha Liujunzi decoction can eradicate H. pylori and alleviate chronic atrophic gastric mucosal inflammation. The treatment is effective and safe to cure HP-induced chronic atrophic gastritis.

32627447|t|[Traditional Chinese medicine insights of newly-diagnosed and young hypertension and clinical practice of Tianma Gouteng Decoction for hypertension treatment].
32627447|a|Hypertension is a global major public health problem. Early intervention and timely blocking are necessary for newly-diagnosed hypertensive and young hypertensive patients. Tianma Gouteng Decoction recorded in Zabing Zhengzhi Xinyi written by HU Guangci has the major functions in treating excess syndrome and wind-Yang disturbance syndrome with effects in calming liver-wind, clearing heat and activating blood, and nourishing liver and kidney. As we known, Tianma Gouteng Decoction is a classical formula for treating hypertension. However, due to the limitation of historical conditions, some problems impede Tianma Gouteng Decoction from being handed down successfully, such as uncertain diagnosis, uncertain antihypertensive efficacy and treatment-course. In this case, we ask whether Tianma Gouteng Decoction can be used as antihypertensive therapy and the exactly decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and wonder the half-life of Tianma Gouteng Decoction and the relationship with Western medicine. Therefore, defined prescription and syndrome, efficacy, treatment-course are important in clinical practice. According to the findings, 1 in circle previously, we thought that hypertension was a liver-Yang hyperactivity and liver-wind stirring syndrome, and the liver-based therapy theory was effective. However, based on our study, long-term treatment with Western medicine could block disease progression, control the increased blood pressure and change the pathogenesis and syndrome of traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, the frequency of liver-Yang hyperactivity syndrome "fire syndrome" decreased sharply, and the main syndrome was fluid-retention syndrome and deficiency syndrome. The etiology and pathogenesis of hypertension was prone to deficiency syndrome accompanied with excess syndrome. Therefore, it was necessary to intervene hypertension in "liver-wind" and "liver-Yang" excess syndrome stage, and the early intervention and treatment are important. 2 in circle The newly-diagnosed hypertensive and young hypertensive patients usually had no Western medicine intervention. Thus, the etiology and pathogenesis of hypertension were free from Western medicine, which maintained the initial stage of hypertension in line with the liver-Yang hyperactivity syndrome. 3 in circle The pathological mechanisms of newly-diagnosed and young hypertension were mainly increase in sympathetic activity, active renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, change in morphology of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cell dysfunction. 4 in circle According to the syndrome of Tianma Gouteng Decoction, in modern medicine, Tianma Gouteng Decoction was widely used to treat the early-stage hypertension and the early-intervention of hypertension without Western medicine, particularly newly-diagnosed, young hypertension, hypertension, hypertensive crisis and hypertensive emergency. Tianma Gouteng Decoction can treat such symptoms as headache, dizziness, fullness of head, slurring of speech; facial flushing, conjunctival congestion and blurred vision; dysphoria, anxiety, palpitation, insomnia, mental disorder and hot flushes; dry-mouth with bitter taste and sweeting; myasthenia of limbs and lassitude in loin and legs; brown urine with burning sensation during urination; a solid or liquid stool consistency; red tongue, slippery and rapid pulse, wiry and rapid pulse over to Cunkou. After treatment with Tianma Gouteng Decoction for three to six months, the blood pressure was decreased, and the symptoms were improved with reduction or even discontinuance of Western medicine. According to recent studies, Caul is Polygoni Multiflori of Tianma Gouteng Decoction induced certain hepatotoxicity and increased the risk of long-term treatment. However, with the regular monitoring of biomedical index, long-term treatment with Caulis Polygoni Multiflori(3-10 g.d~(-1) for 3 to 6 months) didn't show hepatic dysfunction. The pharmacological activity of Tianma Gouteng Decoction coincided with the pathology and disease mechanism of newly-diagnosed and young hypertension. Therefore, Tianma Gouteng Decoction was the specific recipe for newly-diagnosed and young hypertension. Therefore, further studies of efficacy, safety and molecular mechanism of Tianma Gouteng Decoction may make a medical breakthrough for hypertension treatment.

18330319|t|[Exploration of quality control of inorganic elements in Chinese herbal medicines for stimulating blood circulation and relaxing muscles and joints by atomic absorption spectrophotometry].
18330319|a|Researches have shown the close relationships between inorganic elements and curative efficiencies of various Chinese herbal medicines. Yet, in studies of chemical composition and quality control of Chinese herbal medicines for stimulating blood circulation and relaxing muscles and joints, inorganic substances are often overlooked. In order to improve and reestablish the standard of quality control of Chinese herbal medicines, the authors attempted a method that would incorporate the composition of inorganic elements as part of the quality control. In the present study, the authors used atomic absorption spectrophotometry to measure the contents of fifteen inorganic elements, namely, Cu, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mo, Ni, Sr, V, Mn, Zn, Na, Cr, Cd, and Hg, in several Chinese herbal medicines, including Da Huo Luo Wan. The authors then discussed the relationship between these inorganic elements and curative efficiencies of these Chinese herbal medicines. By comparing the levels of inorganic elements found in Da Huo Luo Wan with those found in other Chinese herbal medicines used in the study, it was revealed that trace elements, Fe, Cu, Mn, and Zn, contribute to the curative efficiency of Da Huo Luo Wan. The authors' results showed that the amounts of trace elements Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn found in Chinese herbal medicine Da Huo Luo Wan are related to the following curative effects of Da Huo Luo Wan: relieving rheumatism, rectifying breathing and alleviating phlegm, stimulating blood circulation and relaxing muscles and joints. The measurement and analysis of inorganic elements in Da Huo Luo Wan will also provide evidences and references for the fingerprint establishment of Da Huo Luo Wan in the future.
