#	METHODS: This study was carried out in 3 local hospitals in Chengdu, China.

#	After baseline evaluation, eligible patients were randomly assigned to the placebo application for acupoints (PAA) group or the herbal application for acupoints (HAA) group.

#	Patients in the HAA group underwent AP with herbal powder, which was mainly GXSHP, and patients in the PAA group underwent AP with sham drugs.

#	The present study was conducted to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of cheongsangbangpung-tang extract (CBTE) both in vitro and in vivo.

#	METHODS: The in vitro effects of CBTE on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of inflammation-related proteins were examined in RAW 264.7 cells.

#	The levels of nitric oxide (NO) were measured with the Griess reagent.

#	Inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.

#	Inflammation-related proteins were detected by Western blot.

#	The effect of CBTE on acute inflammation in vivo was evaluated using carrageenan (CA)-induced paw oedema.

disease	paw oedema	94	104

#	To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect, paw oedema volume, thickness of the dorsum and ventrum pedis skin, number of infiltrated inflammatory cells, and number of COX-2-, iNOS-immunoreactive cells were measured.

#	RESULTS: In an in vitro study, CBTE inhibited the production of NO and PGE2 and also decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and tumuor necrosis factor-alpha.

#	In LPS-activated macrophages, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling is a pivotal pathway in the inflammatory process.
disease	inflammatory	147	159

#	These plausible molecular mechanisms increased the phosphorylation of I-kappaBalpha, while the activation of NF-kappaB and the phosphorylation of MAPK by LPS were blocked by CBTE treatment.

#	In our in vivo study, a CA-induced acute oedematous paw inflammation rat model was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of CBTE.

#	CBTE significantly reduced the increases in paw swelling, skin thicknesses, infiltrated inflammatory cells and iNOS-, COX-2 positive cells induced by CA injection.

#	Then, the differential miRNA was screened and sequenced in colon tissue using the HiSeq platform.

#	And the differential miR-185-3p gene was verified by RT-PCR.

#	RESULTS: HQT treatment can alleviate the shortening of colon length and reverse the intestinal mucosal injury. miRNA sequencing of colonic tissue showed that miR-185-3p was significantly downregulated in the model group, while HQT could upregulate miR-185-3p, thereby affecting the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)/myosin light chain phosphorylation (p-MLC) pathway and leading to increased expression of occludin protein, which ultimately protected the intestinal epithelial barrier function.

#	Intravital microscopy was used to monitor leukocyte recruitment and the number of non-perfused sinusoids (NPS).

#	Plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities were measured.

#	In another set of experiments, TJ-9 (1 g/kg per day intragastrically) was administered to rats for 7 days.

#	In some experiments, dexamethasone (ST) (2 mg/kg per day intravenously) was administered.

#	RESULTS: In control rats, gut I/R elicited increases in the number of stationary leukocytes, NPS, and plasma TNF-alpha and ALT activities, and these changes were mitigated by the pretreatment with TJ-9.
disease	gut I/R	26	33

#	Pretreatment with an NO synthase inhibitor diminished the protective effects of TJ-9 on the increase in leukostasis in the pericentral region, NPS, and plasma TNF-alpha levels, but not its effect on the increase in leukostasis in the midzonal region, total number of stationary leukocytes, or plasma ALT activities.

#	Pretreatment with an NO synthase inhibitor did not affect the effect of ST.

#	CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TJ-9 attenuates the gut I/R-induced hepatic microvascular dysfunction and inflammatory responses such as TNF-alpha production in the early phase via enhancement of NO production, and sequential hepatocellular damage via its anti-inflammatory effect like corticosteroid effect.

#	The retrieval time limit was from the establishment of the database to June 2020.

#	A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software.

#	Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

#	RESULT: Fifteen RCTs involving 1705 patients were included in the analysis.

#	The meta-analysis results revealed the total effective rate of the treatment group [RR = 1.21, 95% CI (1.15, 1.27), P < 0.00001], bacterial clearance rate [RR = 1.13, 95% CI (1.05, 1.22), P = 0.001], adverse reactions [RR = 0.54, 95% CI (0.38, 0.76), P = 0.0005].

#	There were statistically significant differences in the cooling time, T cell number, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) value decline rate (P < 0.05).

#	There was no statistically significant difference in the decline rate of neutrophils and leukocytes (P > 0.05).

#	Then the rats were administered with corresponding drugs for 8 weeks.

#	After treatment, the serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TAG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were assayed.

#	The activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) in liver tissues were measured.

#	Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) mRNA expressions in liver tissues were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
