27882217	The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the aqueous extract of XHP (AEXHP) has anti-proliferative activity against the Hs578T TNBC cell line, and to elucidate its molecular mechanisms of action.
formula	XHP	79	82
disease	TNBC	142	146

27882217	First, an MTT assay was used to evaluate the anti-proliferative activity of AEXHP on the Hs578T cell line; furthermore, the cell cycle distribution, mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic rate were determined by flow cytometry, and western blot analysis was used to assess the expression of apoptosis and cell cycle regulatory proteins to investigate the mechanisms of action.

27882217	The results revealed that the cell viability was significantly inhibited by AEXHP in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

27882217	Apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential loss were detected, and after treatment with 4, 8 and 12 mg/ml AEXHP for 24 h, cleaved caspase-3 was 1.70-, 1.81- and 1.84-fold of that of the control, while procaspase-3, procaspase-8, cleaved caspase-8, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio were not significantly affected.

27882217	Cell cycle analysis revealed that treatment with AEXHP led to S-phase arrest of Hs578T cells.

27882217	Furthermore, AEXHP treatment resulted in decreased expression of cyclin A and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), and increased expression of cyclin E and p21(Cip1), as compared to the control group.

27882217	In conclusion, the viability of Hs578T cells was significantly inhibited by AEXHP in a dose- and time-dependent manner, the likely mechanisms of which being induction of apoptosis, probably via the intrinsic, Bcl-2-independent pathway, and cell cycle arrest in S phase due to decreased expression of cyclin A and CDK2, and increased expression of cyclin E and p21(Cip1).

33747100	DAVID is used to conduct gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis.

33747100	Then, it is validated by in vitro experiments.

33747100	In this study, the human intestinal epithelial (T84) cells are used and divided into four groups: control group, model group, FSG low-dose group, and FSG high-dose group.
formula	FSG	126	129
formula	FSG	150	153

33747100	After the experiment, the activity of T84 cells is detected by a MTT assay, and the expressions of tight junction protein ZO-1, claudin-1, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), malondialdehyde (MDA), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are examined by immunofluorescence and/or western blotting.

33747100	RESULTS: Eighty-six potential chronic renal failure-related targets are identified by FSG; among them, nine core genes are screened.
disease	chronic renal failure	30	51
formula	FSG	86	89

33747100	Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis shows that the cancer-related signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the HIF1 signaling pathway, and the TNF signaling pathway may play key roles in the treatment of CRF by FSG.
disease	CRF	214	217
formula	FSG	221	224

33747100	The MTT method showed that FSG is not cytotoxic to uremic toxin-induced injured T84 cells.
formula	FSG	27	30

33747100	The results of immunofluorescence and WB indicate that compared with the control group, protein expressions level of ZO-1, claudin-1, and Nrf2 in T84 cells is decreased and protein expressions level of HO-1, MDA, and COX-2 is increased after urinary toxin treatment.

33747100	Instead, compared with the model group, protein expressions level of ZO-1, claudin-1, and Nrf2 in T84 cells is increased and protein expressions level of HO-1, MDA, and COX-2 is decreased after FSG treatment.
formula	FSG	194	197

33747100	CONCLUSION: FSG had a protective effect on urinary toxin-induced intestinal epithelial barrier injury in chronic renal failure, and its mechanism may be related to the upregulation of Nrf2/HO-1 signal transduction and the inhibition of tissue oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.

15626742	Baicalein inhibited the phosphorylation of IkB-alpha, which was followed by decreased expression of the IL-6 and XIAP genes and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3.

15626742	Therefore, HLJDT and Scutellaria radix have an antiproliferative effect on myeloma cells, especially MPC-1- immature myeloma cells, and baicalein may be responsible for the suppressive effect of Scutellaria radix by blocking IkB-alpha degradation.

31551774	In this study we aimed to screen its antiviral components and investigate the potential mechanisms.

31551774	The MDCK cellular research results showed that, among nine predominant ingredients of MHT, L-methylephedrin (LMEP), L-ephedrine (LEP) and D-pseudo- ephedrine (DPEP) significantly inhibited the proliferation of influenza A virus in vitro, and the inhibitory effect at 24 h after the treatment was more obvious than that at 48 h.

27045865	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lipid A is regarded as the bioactive center of LPS and is always used as a drug target.

27045865	In order to obtain the effective components of HJD against sepsis, seven fractions from HJD were tested by a biosensor method for assessing the affinity for lipid A.

27045865	After further separation, the components were isolated from high lipid A-binding fractions and their affinities to lipid A were assessed with the aid of a biosensor.

27045865	Their activities were then assayed by an in vivo experiment administered through a tail vein injection.

27045865	The levels of LPS, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 from the blood were found and pathology experiments were performed.

27045865	RESULTS: Three out of the seven fractions exhibited high lipid A-binding affinities.

27045865	Berberine, baicalin and geniposide were obtained from the three high lipid A-binding fractions.

27045865	The animal experiments indicated that the levels of LPS, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the medicated treatment groups were much lower than that of the model group ((**)P<0.01).

27045865	The medicated treatment groups exhibited stronger protective activities on varying organs in the animal model.

27045865	CONCLUSIONS: Berberine, baicalin and geniposide could neutralize LPS by binding with lipid A and then reduce the release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha induced by LPS.

27045865	Furthermore, berberine, baicalin and geniposide exhibited protective activities on varying organs compared to the animal model established by the LPS-induced.

27045865	These results validate that the components from HJD neutralized LPS and then depressed the release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha induced by LPS.

disease	breast cancer	92	105

24525674	METHODS: In vitro cultured MCF-7 cells were cotreated with JWXYS and Tam.
formula	JWXYS	59	64

24525674	This was followed by MTT ([4,5-cimethylthiazol-2-yl]- 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assays and cell cycle analysis to assess cell proliferation; Western blot analysis was used to analyze the expression of various proteins involved in growth-related signal pathways.

24525674	In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to detect autophagy among the cancer cells.
disease	cancer	73	79

24525674	In vivo analysis used female athymic nude mice implanted with MCF-7 cells; these mice were randomly assigned to 6 groups.

24525674	All mice were killed humanely after 21 days of treatment; body weight, tumor volume, and tumor weight were then measured.
disease	tumor	71	76
disease	tumor	89	94

24525674	RESULTS: JWXYS was not cytotoxic to MCF-7 cells, based on the fact that there were no statistically significant changes between the JWXYS + Tam groups and the Tam-alone group in cell numbers, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation signals, the latter including the expression levels of AKT, ERK, P38, p27(Kip1), and light chain (LC3)-I, II.
formula	JWXYS	9	14
formula	JWXYS	132	137

24525674	Furthermore, using the MCF-7 xenograft mouse model, there were no significant changes between the JWXYS (1.3-3.9 gm/kg) + Tam groups and the Tam-alone group in terms of tumor weight and the protein expression levels of AKT, ERK, P38, and p27 (Kip1).
formula	JWXYS	98	103
disease	tumor	169	174

24525674	However, there was a significant decrease in LC3-II protein expression with the low-dose JWXYS + Tam group but not with the middle- or high-dose JWXYS + Tam groups compared with the Tam-alone group.
formula	JWXYS	89	94
formula	JWXYS	145	150

24525674	CONCLUSION: Based on in vitro studies and in vivo functional studies, there is no obvious interaction between JWXYS and Tam.

7598092	Liver cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased 2 and 24 hrs after CCl4 injection, while liver cytosolic catalase and glutathione reductase (GSSG-R) activities decreased 24 hrs after the injection.

7598092	At 2 and 24 hrs after CCl4 treatment, liver cytosolic Se-containing glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activity did not change and liver cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) activity increased.

7598092	Post-oral TJ-8 administration significantly ameliorated decreases in liver SOD, catalase, and GSSG-R activities at 24 hrs after CCl4 injection, but did not affect liver Se-GSH-px and increased liver G-6-PDH activities at 24 hrs after the injection.

7598092	Although increased liver lipid peroxide level and decreased liver reduced glutathione and ascorbic acid levels were observed 2 and 24 hrs after CCl4 injection, post-oral TJ-8 administration significantly prevented these changes found at 24 hrs after injection.

7598092	These results indicate that post-oral TJ-8 administration can prevent the progression of acute liver injury in CCl4-injected rats by inhibiting enhanced lipid peroxidation and by improving disrupted active oxygen metabolism in the injured liver.

35481834	The essential role of gut microbiota was further verified by both the diminished protective effects with antibiotics-induced gut microbiota depletion and the transferable renal protection with fecal microbiota transplantation.

35481834	All these results suggested that gut microbiota mediates the nephroprotective effects of QYG against cisplatin-induced AKI, potentially via increasing the production of SCFAs, thus suppressing histone deacetylase expression and activity, and reducing the accumulation of uremic toxins, thereby alleviating fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in renal tissue.

31367159	Control mice received either saline gavage or FMT from ND-fed mice receiving saline gavage as mentioned above.

31367159	Body weight was monitored bi-weekly.

31367159	Food consumption of each cage hosting five mice was recorded weekly.

31367159	To monitor blood glucose, total cholesterol, and total triglycerides, blood samples were collected via submandibular bleeding after 6 h fasting.

31367159	Oxygen consumption rate was monitored with metabolic cages.

31367159	Feces were collected, and fecal DNA was extracted.

31367159	Profiles of gut microbiota were mapped by metagenomic sequencing.

31367159	RESULTS: We found that CR and LZD treatment significantly reduced the body weight of mice fed with ND (28.71 +/- 0.29 vs 28.05 +/- 0.15, P < 0.05), but did not affect plasma total cholesterol or total triglyceride levels.

34457026	Bioinformatics analysis was performed to provide further information regarding the differentially expressed miRNAs.

34457026	Five representative differentially expressed miRNAs and four predicted target genes were further validated using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).

34457026	Results.

34457026	We identified 33 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the SJZT group compared with the Model group.
formula	SJZT	66	70

34457026	Among them, 32 miRNAs were upregulated and 1 miRNA was downregulated.

34457026	Bioinformatic analysis showed that most of miRNAs acted as tumor suppressors and their target genes participated in multiple signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, microRNAs in cancer, and Wnt signaling pathway.

34457026	Network analysis revealed that miR-223-3p and miR-205-5p shared two targets POU2F1 (encoding POU class 2 homeobox 1) and FUT9 (encoding fucosyltransferase 9), suggesting they have a common role in certain pathways.

34457026	Conclusion.

34457026	This study provided novel insights into the anticancer mechanism of SJZT against gastric cancer, which might be partly related to the modulation of miRNA expression and their target pathways in tumors.

24574726	The control groups included conventional treatment (Western medicinal treatment), placebo, and no treatment (blank), but not acupuncture.

24574726	The main outcome index was clinical effectiveness, which was based on the gastric emptying test and variations in the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms between the treatment and control groups after intervention.

24574726	Data extraction, analysis, and quality assessment were conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions, Version 5.1.0.

24574726	RESULTS: Ten RCTs involving 867 patients (441 in the experimental groups, and 426 in the control groups) were identified, and the overall methodological quality was evaluated as generally low.

24574726	In the treatment groups, all 10 trials used herbs alone as the treatment, whereas all control groups used prokinetic medicine.

24574726	The period of intervention ranged from 2 to 8 wk.

24574726	Three classes were used to evaluate treatment efficacy: significant effective, effective, and ineffective, and all trials used the clinical effective rate (based on the gastric emptying test and changes in GI symptoms) to evaluate efficacy.

24574726	The data showed that the effects of XSLJZD for the treatment of DGP were superior to the control group (n = 867, RR =1.33, 95%CI: 1.24-1.42, Z = 8.11, P < 0.00001).

11117269	In this study, a house-dust-mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus [Der p])-sensitized murine model of asthma was used to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of XQLT on the allergen-induced airway inflammation in asthma.

11117269	METHODS: Three different protocols were designed to evaluate the treatment and/ or long-term prophylactic effect of XQLT in Der p-sensitized mice.
formula	XQLT	116	120

11117269	XQLT extracts (1 gm/kg) were administered to sensitized mice 1 h before allergen challenge (AC) (group A), 24 h after AC (group B), and every other day six times before AC (group C), respectively.
formula	XQLT	0	4

11117269	Cellular infiltration and T-cell subsets in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of allergen-challenged mice were analyzed.

11117269	Intrapulmonary lymphocytes were also isolated to evaluate their response to allergen stimulation.

11117269	RESULTS: When XQLT was administered to the sensitized mice before AC (groups A and C), it suppressed airway inflammation by decreasing the number of total cells and eosinophil infiltration in the BALF, and downregulated the allergen- or mitogen-induced intrapulmonary lymphocyte response of sensitized mice as compared to those of controls.
formula	XQLT	14	18
disease	airway inflammation	101	120

11117269	This immunomodulatory effect of XQLT may be exerted through the regulation of T-cell subsets by elevation or activation of the CD8+ and double-negative T-cell population in the lung.
formula	XQLT	32	36

11117269	However, the administration of XQLT to sensitized mice 24 h after AC (group B) did not have the same inhibitory effect on the airway inflammation as XQLT given before AC.

disease	hypertension	67	79

32627447	However, based on our study, long-term treatment with Western medicine could block disease progression, control the increased blood pressure and change the pathogenesis and syndrome of traditional Chinese medicine.

32627447	Therefore, the frequency of liver-Yang hyperactivity syndrome "fire syndrome" decreased sharply, and the main syndrome was fluid-retention syndrome and deficiency syndrome.

32627447	The etiology and pathogenesis of hypertension was prone to deficiency syndrome accompanied with excess syndrome.
